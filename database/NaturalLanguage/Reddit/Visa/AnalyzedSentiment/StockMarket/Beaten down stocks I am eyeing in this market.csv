,"Hi all, long time lurker here and I've found this subreddit to be tremendously useful! With the recent tech stock beatdown, here are some of the stocks I am eyeing and looking to buy: Corsair (CRSR) : had stellar earnings and they make fantastic products in the gaming and PC hardware space. They're making good acquisitions in the streaming space. Salesforce (CRM) : another solid company that has taken a big beating for no apparent reason. They recently acquired Slack and I dont see any other competitor being remotely close in the CRM space. Square (SQ): revolutionizing payments for small businesses and making key moves in the crypto space. Cloudflare (NET): yet to turn profitable but a great tech company that is growing rapidly. Snowflake (SNOW): another tech company that was overvalued upon IPO and climbed all the way to $429 before being brought back to earth. Currently trading at $213 Costco (COST): solid company that has a loyal following and great business model. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM): market leader in chip manufacturing and with the current shortage in chips, their future looks great. Teladoc (TDOC): one of the big companies in the telemedicine space that should thrive in the post covid world as more patients want the convenience of seeing their doctor from the comfort of their own home. Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY): pharma giant that made key acquisitions recently (Celgene and Myokardia) that should boost their pipeline and revenue. Also pays good dividend. Facebook (FB) : social media giant that isn't going away anytime soon. Would be interesting to see how they leverage Oculus to boost their revenue. CVS (CVS) : pharmacy giant that should get a boost from covid vaccine rollout and their new in-house clinics. Tattooed Chef (TTCF): fast growing company in the plant based protein and healthy frozen foods space. They have products in almost all major retailers and are rapidly expanding. Nvidia (NVDA): leader in GPU space and a tech giant. Palantir (PLTR): big data company with a revolutionary product that is just getting started. Qualcomm (QCOM): makes chips for phones and are well established for the 5G Era American Tower Corp (AMT): they make/ rent out cell signal towers and should benefit from the move to 5G Planet13 Holdings (PLNHF): they make giant superstores for Marijuana sale and are set to have their own brand of products Of course I would also add Apple, Visa, Microsoft, and Amazon if they dipped enough. What stocks did I miss? Are there any others you would suggest keeping an eye on during the recent sell-off? Thank you!","Hello!

The risk-reward proposition is good. If a turnaround is effectuated, it has the potential to 3x in order to trade in line with its peers. At 12 times earnings and a 2%+ dividend, the stock is cheap, so the downside risk is minimal. INTC's legacy PC-centric business is growing, but it doesn't trade like it (the market just assumes that PCs are a dead growth category). And you get the faster-growing data center, self-driving MobilEye, and all the Intel VC businesses. MobilEye is particularly exciting. As a standalone business, I believe it would trade at something like a $25 billion market cap in this market - maybe higher.",2,0.554,POSITIVE,0.949

Still a dicey time to to go shopping IMO, but I either own or am watching a few of these myself. Still scoping out ROKU/MGNI/TTD as potential CTV plays. I also like the price for POSH, although that's one where I bought the dip and fell into a bull trap. RIDE is a similar situation, but I have high expectations for them as well and IDK how much cheaper that stock is going to get either. Not to mention DMYI as a SPAC to merge with IonQ, as well as HIMS which went up massively, only to be down near what I bought it for.As a side note, I've been watching CloudFlare and noticed that one has gotten its ass handed to it massively even before the Nasdaq really started to head south.
