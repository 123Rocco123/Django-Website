,"(https://youtu.be/Wl0acHG3nzM?t=1) I made this video in January explaining my top 10 largest holdings in my portfolio going into 2019. These holdings have strong revenue and earnings growth, and pass my fundamental eye test (strong margins, high ROIC, strong free cash flow). Additional holdings that I’ve purchased this year into weakness include Amazon (AMZN) and Fiserv (FISV). This past week I also scooped up shares of BioTelemetry (BEAT) and a small position in Kraft Heinz (KHC) - I know it’s not popular but it’s a selective contrarian pick on a dog of a stock. I want to see that massive gap fill a little. BEAT is already up about 9% since purchasing. I enjoy stock analysis and hope you find my rationale for these selections somewhat helpful and entertaining. I think the biggest component here is education, I know I could pick highly trendy stocks like NIO, CGC, CRON, TSLA...but I look for strong companies. We’ve seen how these stocks can pullback with a little market volatility, and we’re late in the economic cycle so we have to be very selective. Share some of your holdings with me! I’m pretty active on YouTube and Reddit. I always enjoy letting beginners know how I got started and which resources I use. Microsoft (MSFT) Facebook (FB) Trex (TREX) Alibaba (BABA) Visa (V) Intuit (INTU) Adobe (ADBE) Mastercard (MA) Apple (AAPL) AbbVie (ABBV)","I would add waste management (wm). Solid utility company, it just keeps making money.Also the weed stocks, I have alot of faith in them for the long term. But it is hard to guess which one will earn majority market share. Cgc, cron are the favorites, but they burn cash extremely quickly and will be volatile. Companies like apria (apha), ctst and hexo are great value buys.",0,0.556,NEGATIVE,0.585
