When CARES act expires at end of July we can see the true number of people that cant afford rent/mortgage payments and see what different companies are facing. Q2 earnings are also coming up this month so its a good time to look at what companies are doing better or worse there.,0,0.536,NEGATIVE,0.8

I read on here weeks ago that a Vanguard fund was taking AAPL off . I still remember a few years ago when they shunned the iPhone in China . Also I personally think that Tim Cook is for Apple what Steve Balmer was for MSFT . And MSFT is riding the Satya Nadella wave . All good news on the Cloud front cuz of their hybrid technology. They also turned office into an income stream. Xbox ok and they purchased Minecraft on that front . What has AAPL done ? Credit card with Goldman: pathetic , video streaming too late and weak content , Apple music probably suffering from Spotify . Apple watch better but IMO meh .I have a joke at home. My adult sons and husband all have iPhones. I have a cheap $150-250 Android. They keep asking why I don't have a laptop. So I joke with an Android all you need is a phone .

They also have a Covid vaccine in the works using this same technology. Another vaccine may come before this one, but if this works then it has a higher chance of adapting to new mutations of the coronavirus, which would be much more valuable.
