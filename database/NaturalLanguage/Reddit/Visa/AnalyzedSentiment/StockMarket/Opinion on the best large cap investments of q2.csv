,"if you had 8000 to allocate toward large capped orgs that will be profitable in q2, who would you pick? I like Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, Johnson and Johnson, Apple, and Visa Q3 = Darden, Marriott, MgM, and Vail Resort. Q4 = all of q3 plus Boeing, airlines, and cruises.","I might be biased because i own about 2500$ of Visa, 2600$ of Facebook and about 5000$ of Microsoft and 3000$ of google. I love all of those long term, its all about how much you wanna diversify. Id love some Amazon at some point but i dont have any spare cash for now.",0,0.52,POSITIVE,0.975

Facebook seems eager to make investments, buy competitors and dive into every bodies lives. In a world where competitors are focused on selling to the Chinese, Facebook is focusing on India.",0,0.526,NEGATIVE,0.997

And yeah Like you noticed I wasn’t defending FB being a one trick, just saying google was diversifying but I still like FB. Monetization of what’s app will be huge even without ads if wechat is any comparison. (Last I checked wechat made about 5b without advertisements in one quarter)",3,0.516,NEGATIVE,0.993
