I'd be buying for long term. Thanks,"It's seemingly always a good time to buy Visa. They have by far the largest number of cardholders worldwide, and are still expanding further, especially into Asia. Moreover, the business model is rather simple and foolproof business model.You could wait for a drawback day, though it would probably only make a significant difference if you waited for a market correction. That may or may not happen anytime soon -- it's not worth trying to time the market -- so I would go in as soon as possible. Definitely before earnings, at any rate.You can also look at Mastercard and Paypal as well.",0,0.551,NEGATIVE,0.855
