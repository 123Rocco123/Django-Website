,"I cannot find the answer to my question anywhere hopefully one of you can help. Let's say , for example, i started with 30k. Bought VISA and made 20k. Sitting at 50k now (20k profit) but i re-invest a couple days later the entire 50k and get on BOEING and profit 20k on that.. now sitting 70k. sale BOEING, and mind you i never pull completely out of my etrade account i just sale. so now i am at 40k profit. I then buy a safe ETF until my 1 year comes due to pull out for long term taxes. will they tax my 40k long term or short term?","Short term v. Long term has nothing to do with when you pull the money out of your account, it has to do with when you close the position. If you buy Visa and sell it within a year then it is short term gain(loss), if you hold it more than a year then it is long term gain(loss). From your description it seems like all your gain will be short term",0,0.575,NEGATIVE,0.996

In the beginning of next year you will get a 1099 from your brokerage that will show your gains and losses. Every time you open and close a position it will be reported as a gain or a loss regardless of where the cash went after you closed it",2,0.542,NEGATIVE,1.0

Short-term gains are taxed as ordinary income, so whatever your tax bracket is for your income will be the tax percentage",2,0.525,NEGATIVE,0.989
