,"Stocks rose on Monday, following a volatile week, with technology stocks leading the pack looking to reclaim lost ground. After leading the market higher in 2020, tech stocks have largely been under pressure following a sharp rise in Treasury yields. Banks, industrials, and other reopening stock underperformed, giving back some recent gains, but looking ahead, we expect the rotation out of tech stocks and into cyclical and reopening stocks to continue as the economy continues to gradually open back up. After jumping to one-year highs last week, the 10 year Treasury yield retreated to hover slightly below 1.7% (1.68% at the time of writing). The sharp contrast between the performance of the Dow and the Nasdaq in recent weeks underscores the increasing rotation out of high-flying tech stocks that led the markets higher last year and into stocks that are poised to directly benefit from economic reopening. The energy and financials sectors have also been leading gains in the S&P 500, outperforming tech and growth stocks in 2021. Rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth stocks the most because these companies require a lot of capital to fund their growth and expansion and generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. Higher yields make it more expensive to borrow capital. It’s important to remember that despite rising yields, the benchmark 10-year yield remains at historic lows, roughly half what it was five years ago. Last week, The Federal Reserve reiterated its commitment to maintaining interest rates near zero and asset purchase program at a pace of $120 billion per month in place for the foreseeable future, even as the US economy shows signs of gaining momentum thanks to an increase in the pace of vaccination and the recently passed stimulus package. FOMC members now expect the unemployment rate to dip to 4.5% by the end of this year with an inflation rate of 2.4%. Three months earlier, the Fed expected an unemployment rate to improve to only 5.0% with core personal consumption expenditures rising by just 1.8% by year-end. Real GDP growth will likely come in at 6.5% this year, the Fed projected, up sharply from its previous 4.2% growth forecast. Steve Sosnick, chief strategist of at Interactive Brokers said of the Fed’s comments, “Chairman Powell was pretty adamant, as he had been in front of Congress as well, that he was not really inclined to do anything preemptive about inflation, but react to it if inflation becomes a problem if we’re at full employment. We’re a long way off from that, but the bond market now is getting nervous that we could see inflation becoming a problem before the Fed does anything about it. And that’s the little bit of a freak out that we had been seeing in bonds.” Highlights Tomorrow after the close, Gamestop (GME) is reporting earnings.

,"Stocks rose on Monday, following a volatile week, with technology stocks leading the pack looking to reclaim lost ground. After leading the market higher in 2020, tech stocks have largely been under pressure following a sharp rise in Treasury yields. Banks, industrials, and other reopening stock underperformed, giving back some recent gains, but looking ahead, we expect the rotation out of tech stocks and into cyclical and reopening stocks to continue as the economy continues to gradually open back up. After jumping to one-year highs last week, the 10 year Treasury yield retreated to hover slightly below 1.7% (1.68% at the time of writing). The sharp contrast between the performance of the Dow and the Nasdaq in recent weeks underscores the increasing rotation out of high-flying tech stocks that led the markets higher last year and into stocks that are poised to directly benefit from economic reopening. The energy and financials sectors have also been leading gains in the S&P 500, outperforming tech and growth stocks in 2021. Rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth stocks the most because these companies require a lot of capital to fund their growth and expansion and generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. Higher yields make it more expensive to borrow capital. It’s important to remember that despite rising yields, the benchmark 10-year yield remains at historic lows, roughly half what it was five years ago. Last week, The Federal Reserve reiterated its commitment to maintaining interest rates near zero and asset purchase program at a pace of $120 billion per month in place for the foreseeable future, even as the US economy shows signs of gaining momentum thanks to an increase in the pace of vaccination and the recently passed stimulus package. FOMC members now expect the unemployment rate to dip to 4.5% by the end of this year with an inflation rate of 2.4%. Three months earlier, the Fed expected an unemployment rate to improve to only 5.0% with core personal consumption expenditures rising by just 1.8% by year-end. Real GDP growth will likely come in at 6.5% this year, the Fed projected, up sharply from its previous 4.2% growth forecast. Steve Sosnick, chief strategist of at Interactive Brokers said of the Fed’s comments, “Chairman Powell was pretty adamant, as he had been in front of Congress as well, that he was not really inclined to do anything preemptive about inflation, but react to it if inflation becomes a problem if we’re at full employment. We’re a long way off from that, but the bond market now is getting nervous that we could see inflation becoming a problem before the Fed does anything about it. And that’s the little bit of a freak out that we had been seeing in bonds.” Highlights Tomorrow after the close, Gamestop (GME) is reporting earnings.

Whether the target ends up hitting, really depends on too many factors to say.I'd caution against black and white thinking in the market, sometime analyst ratings are useful and help drive sentiment other times not.
