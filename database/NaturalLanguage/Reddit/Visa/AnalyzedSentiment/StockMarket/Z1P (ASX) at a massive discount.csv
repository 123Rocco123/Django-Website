,"Hi all, last week zip signed a deal with VISA, apple and google to make their service usable in stores, this will probably double the transaction volume they do and further fight credit cards. And yet since then their stocks have only gone down. It makes no sense and when earnings release stocks will fly. The only reason they are down is because Westpac had to sell their share in the company as they made a deal with afterpay. There is literally no reason for zip to be losing, this is potentially the best news the company has ever released. This isn't financial advice, just pointing out that there's no reason, in my opinion, for it to be down and it should go up as soon as people realise that. Cheers, See you at the moon.",BNPL sector is here to stay but like of APT and ZIP do not really have a moat around them. VISA and Mastercard really do not have to do much if they want to get into this space. Infrastructure is there already in terms of Point of sales support. All they need is to do some changes in the backend software and they are good to go.,0,0.535,NEGATIVE,0.903

Cheers, See you at the moon.",I don't know crap about much but I will point out we've seen multiple companies where the infrastructure was present to make a small change to prevent a new company from dominating a niche (sears vs amazon for example) and they failed to do so. Might not be a bad idea to grab a few just in case.,1,0.554,NEGATIVE,1.0
