The company achieved its fifth consecutive quarter of revenue growth, indicating strong execution despite a challenging industry environment. LRCX is well-positioned to benefit from technology upgrades in NAND, which is expected to drive spending recovery. The company is seeing strong momentum in advanced packaging, with SABRE 3D revenue more than doubling this year. LRCX is experiencing strong customer demand for productivity enhancements and equipment intelligence services, with increased adoption of its offerings. 👎 Negative Points Domestic China WFE is expected to decline in the second half of the year, impacting LRCX's revenue from the region. Gross margin decreased slightly due to a decline in customer mix and increased incentive compensation. Operating expenses increased due to higher program spending and incentive compensation, impacting profitability. The NAND segment has experienced a prolonged down cycle, with spending expected to increase only in 2025. Lam Research anticipates a headwind in customer mix affecting gross margins due to a lower percentage of revenue from China. First Solar (FSLR): Undervalued 🟢 👍 Positive Points First Solar achieved a record quarterly production of 3.8 gigawatts, demonstrating strong manufacturing capabilities. The company inaugurated a new $1.1 billion Alabama facility, adding 3.5 gigawatts of solar manufacturing capacity, with plans for further expansion in Louisiana. First Solar has a robust contracted backlog of 73.3 gigawatts, providing long-term revenue visibility. The company is launching CuRe production, aiming to enhance its technology offerings and capture additional revenue through contractual adjusters. First Solar was recognized by MIT Technology Review and Time Magazine for its leadership in solar technology and innovation. 👎 Negative Points FSLR faced a $50 million product warranty charge due to manufacturing issues with its Series 7 product. The company experienced operational challenges, including hurricanes and logistical disruptions, impacting financial performance. There is ongoing pressure from Chinese dumping in the Indian market, leading to depressed ASPs and strategic shifts in production. First Solar had to terminate a contract with Plug Power due to project delays, impacting its bookings. The company is facing intellectual property challenges within the solar manufacturing sector, particularly related to TOPCon patents. Medpace (MEDP): Undervalued 🟢 👍 Positive Points Revenue for the third quarter of 2024 was $533.3 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 8.3%. EBITDA for the third quarter increased by 31.7% compared to the same period in 2023, reaching $118.8 million. Net income for the third quarter rose by 36.7% year-over-year, driven by interest income and partially offset by a higher effective tax rate. Ending backlog as of September 30, 2024, was approximately $2.9 billion, an increase of 8.8% from the prior year. The company expects to convert approximately $1.62 billion of backlog into revenue over the next 12 months, indicating strong future revenue potential. 👎 Negative Points Backlog cancellations in Q3 were above the usual range, marking three consecutive quarters of elevated cancellations. Net new business awards decreased by 12.7% from the prior year, resulting in a net book-to-bill ratio of 1.0 for the quarter. The elevated cancellations are expected to depress reported net backlog awards in Q4 and Q1 of 2025. RFPs were down modestly on a year-over-year and sequential basis, indicating a potential slowdown in new business opportunities. Gross bookings were lower in the quarter due to prior cancellations, impacting the overall business momentum. Visa (V): Undervalued 🟢 👍 Positive Points Visa reported strong financial results for the fourth quarter, with net revenue of $9.6 billion, up 12% year-over-year, and EPS up 16%.

Visa continues to expand its consumer payments business, with over 4.6 billion credentials, up 7% year-over-year, and 11.5 billion [tok]-ens, with more than 30% of total transactions [tok]-enized. The company has made significant strides in new flows, with revenue growing 22% year-over-year in constant dollars, and Visa Direct transactions increasing by 38%. Visa has successfully renewed and expanded several key partnerships globally, including agreements with major clients like Grupo Pramerica, SMCC, Alrajhi, and Standard Chartered Bank. 👎 Negative Points Visa faces regulatory challenges, including a lawsuit by the Department of Justice, which the company believes is meritless. The company experienced slower growth in Asia Pacific payments volume, primarily due to macroeconomic conditions, particularly in Mainland China. Cross-border travel volume growth was lower than expected, mainly due to challenges in Asia Pacific travel corridors. Visa anticipates a significant increase in client incentives in fiscal 2025, which could impact net revenue growth. The company expects a step down in adjusted net revenue growth from Q4 2024 to Q1 2025 due to various factors, including increased incentives and the timing of pricing actions. Alphabet (GOOGL): Undervalued 🟢 👍 Positive Points Alphabet reported a 15% increase in consolidated revenue, with Google Cloud revenue growing by 35% year-over-year. The company has made significant advancements in AI, with the Gemini models being integrated across all major products and platforms, reaching over 1 billion users. YouTube's combined ad and subscription revenue surpassed $50 billion over the past four quarters, driven by strong growth in YouTube TV, NFL Sunday Ticket, and YouTube Music Premium. Alphabet is making substantial investments in clean energy, including a corporate agreement to purchase nuclear energy, supporting its commitment to sustainability. The company is seeing strong engagement and increased search usage with the rollout of AI Overviews to over 100 new countries and territories. 👎 Negative Points Network advertising revenue declined by 2% year-over-year, indicating challenges in this segment. The company faces potential legal challenges from the DOJ, which could impact its search agreements with partners like Apple. Alphabet is experiencing increased costs, with total cost of revenue up by 10% and operating expenses rising by 5%. There is a headwind to year-over-year growth in subscription platforms and devices revenue due to the pull forward of Made by Google launches. The company is facing increased competition in the AI space, with a need to continuously innovate to maintain its leadership position. Microsoft (MSFT): Fairly Valued 🔵 👍 Positive Points Microsoft Cloud revenue surpassed $38.9 billion, marking a 22% increase, driven by strong demand for AI and cloud services. AI business is on track to surpass an annual revenue run rate of $10 billion next quarter, making it the fastest-growing business in Microsoft's history. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 33% in constant currency, with healthy consumption trends. Microsoft 365 Copilot adoption is accelerating, with nearly 70% of the Fortune 500 using it, and customers continue to adopt it at a faster rate than any other new Microsoft 365 suite. LinkedIn revenue increased 10%, with record engagement and growth across all lines of business. 👎 Negative Points Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased by 2 points year over year, driven by scaling AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased by 12%, partly due to the Activision acquisition, impacting overall profitability. Free cash flow decreased by 7% year over year, reflecting higher capital expenditures to support cloud and AI offerings. Supply constraints, particularly in AI infrastructure, are impacting Azure's ability to meet demand, leading to potential growth deceleration. The Activision acquisition had a negative $0.05 impact on earnings per share due to purchase accounting adjustments and related costs.",Cool post - long MSFT and LRCX.,0,0.528,POSITIVE,0.998
