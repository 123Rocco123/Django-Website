I wanted to buy once it falls a bit but now it’s just suspicious!,"Essentially if you own GOOG you can’t vote the shares at meetings, it’s as if you’re a Google exec in terms of voting rights, deferring your potential views to that of the leadership. If you own GOOG you probably like how the company is run and want more of that. Owning GOOGL contrarily allows you to vote at meetings as if you are an individual interested in running the company.Google has these 2 classes of shares because the executive suite wants to retain overall guidance of the company. GOOG tends to trade at a slight premium to GOOGL because of this.Not sure what visas version of this is, it could be something completely different. It’s advisable to go to their investor relations page and read about their ownership structure. It’s advisable to always do this for any company you invest in.Edit I swapped them",4,0.547,NEGATIVE,0.594

But another commenter above nailed it, it’s not as though voting rights are the preferred situation here. Alphabet is a unique company with some big brains at the helm, and I suppose the idea is that the market’s shares would never be as smart or as knowledgable as the leadership’s. It’s priced with the kinda accepted assumption that you and you and you and you and me on wall st are never going to going to have a better idea of running alphabet than the c suite.Alphabet has class A voting rights, class B executive shares w/ 10-1 voting power, and class C GOOG that essentially are 1/10 of class B.I hold goog",6,0.521,NEGATIVE,0.844

For example, in your hypothetical situation 3:45 being the best time to buy would mean the price is lowest at that point. If that was the case, they’d buy at 3:45 and sell microseconds later as soon as the price went up, removing the opportunity for anyone else to buy at the 3:45 time.Generally speaking, don’t sweat the small things - just buy companies you believe are good long term investments - you’ll do just fine 🙂",4,0.535,NEGATIVE,0.997

You have to pay a fee to make this bet called a “premium.”So for example, maybe I bet that Apple will go up to a certain price by December. It cost me $1200 to make this bet. The price it cost me is more or less dictated by how risky the bet is. A more risky bet will be cheaper, but have a lower chance of paying off. A less risky bet will be more expensive to make but more likely to pay off. As that date approaches, if my bet it looking correct or incorrect, the value of my bet will either increase or decrease. At any time I could try to sell my bet to someone else for whatever it’s currently worth (netting me a profit or loss perhaps). So if my bet is looking really good in 2 weeks, I might be able to sell my December Apple bet for $1500 instead of $1200, making me $300.If the date approaches and I’m very wrong, my bet will likely start approaching $0 in worth, as nobody would want to buy it from me since it’s looking wrong.Simplified a few things, but that’s more or less how options work.
