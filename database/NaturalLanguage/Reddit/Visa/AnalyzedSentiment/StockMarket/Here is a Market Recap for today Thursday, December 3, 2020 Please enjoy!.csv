,"PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, December 3, 2020 The stock market rose before pulling back steeply in the last hour of the session after data was released showing new weekly jobless fell more than expected, even as business content with surging coronavirus cases and the reimposition of restrictions. The S&P 500 reached an intraday record-high once again. In good news, the UK became the first western country to grant emergency use authorization for the coronavirus vaccine developed by Pfizer (PFE) and BioNTech (BNTX) and will reportedly purchase 40 million doses and expect inoculation to begin starting next week. The UK government is rolling out the vaccine in priority groups, with the elderly and healthcare professionals at the top of the list. Health Minister Matt Hancock said, “From early next week we will start the program of vaccinating people against COVID-19 in this country.” Unfortunately, despite the positive vaccine news, the reality is that rolling out the vaccine to the wider population is expected to take a few months. In the meantime, cases continue to surge in the United States. Dr. Robert Redford, Director of the CDC said he thinks January and February are “going to be the most difficult months in the public health history of this nation, largely because of the stress that’s going to be put on our healthcare system”. Sadly, yesterday the US reported the worst daily death toll since the pandemic began, with more than 2,760 people dying from the virus. Experts say they expect the death toll to worsen in the coming days. To make matters worse, hospitalizations also reached an all-time high for about the 24th day in a row. As of yesterday, there were more than 100,000 patients hospitalized from coronavirus -- more than double the number of patients at the beginning of November. Compared to the first wave earlier in the year, where cases were mainly concentrated in the Northeast of the country, today the pandemic is being felt across the whole country. Today, the Department of Labor released its weekly unemployment report. In a positive surprise, new weekly jobless claims fell more than was expected even with the surge in coronavirus and the reimposition of stay-in-place restrictions across many states. For the week ending November 28, there were 712,000 new claims vs 775,000 expected. Continuing claims, which shows the amount of people entering their second week of jobless claims, also fell to 5.52 million vs 5.8 million estimate. Highlights Not really stock market related but we thought it was cool. Former Presidents Clinton, Bush, and Obama said they will take the COVID vaccine publicly in order to foster public trust in the vaccine. The Wall Street Journal reported that Pfizer (PFE) expect to ship only half of the vaccines it had planned in 2020 because of supply chain issues. A&T Inc's Warner Bros studio on Thursday announced that it will make all of its 2021 films available in theaters and on the HBO Max streaming service starting on the same day, an unprecedented shift in response to the coronavirus pandemic that sank shares of movie theater operators. A company founded by Tom Siebel called C3 IoT is expected to begin trading via IPO very soon, rumors are Wednesday of next week.

,"PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, December 3, 2020 The stock market rose before pulling back steeply in the last hour of the session after data was released showing new weekly jobless fell more than expected, even as business content with surging coronavirus cases and the reimposition of restrictions. The S&P 500 reached an intraday record-high once again. In good news, the UK became the first western country to grant emergency use authorization for the coronavirus vaccine developed by Pfizer (PFE) and BioNTech (BNTX) and will reportedly purchase 40 million doses and expect inoculation to begin starting next week. The UK government is rolling out the vaccine in priority groups, with the elderly and healthcare professionals at the top of the list. Health Minister Matt Hancock said, “From early next week we will start the program of vaccinating people against COVID-19 in this country.” Unfortunately, despite the positive vaccine news, the reality is that rolling out the vaccine to the wider population is expected to take a few months. In the meantime, cases continue to surge in the United States.

Sadly, yesterday the US reported the worst daily death toll since the pandemic began, with more than 2,760 people dying from the virus. Experts say they expect the death toll to worsen in the coming days. To make matters worse, hospitalizations also reached an all-time high for about the 24th day in a row. As of yesterday, there were more than 100,000 patients hospitalized from coronavirus -- more than double the number of patients at the beginning of November. Compared to the first wave earlier in the year, where cases were mainly concentrated in the Northeast of the country, today the pandemic is being felt across the whole country. Today, the Department of Labor released its weekly unemployment report. In a positive surprise, new weekly jobless claims fell more than was expected even with the surge in coronavirus and the reimposition of stay-in-place restrictions across many states. For the week ending November 28, there were 712,000 new claims vs 775,000 expected.

,"PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, December 3, 2020 The stock market rose before pulling back steeply in the last hour of the session after data was released showing new weekly jobless fell more than expected, even as business content with surging coronavirus cases and the reimposition of restrictions. The S&P 500 reached an intraday record-high once again. In good news, the UK became the first western country to grant emergency use authorization for the coronavirus vaccine developed by Pfizer (PFE) and BioNTech (BNTX) and will reportedly purchase 40 million doses and expect inoculation to begin starting next week. The UK government is rolling out the vaccine in priority groups, with the elderly and healthcare professionals at the top of the list. Health Minister Matt Hancock said, “From early next week we will start the program of vaccinating people against COVID-19 in this country.” Unfortunately, despite the positive vaccine news, the reality is that rolling out the vaccine to the wider population is expected to take a few months. In the meantime, cases continue to surge in the United States. Dr. Robert Redford, Director of the CDC said he thinks January and February are “going to be the most difficult months in the public health history of this nation, largely because of the stress that’s going to be put on our healthcare system”. Sadly, yesterday the US reported the worst daily death toll since the pandemic began, with more than 2,760 people dying from the virus. Experts say they expect the death toll to worsen in the coming days. To make matters worse, hospitalizations also reached an all-time high for about the 24th day in a row. As of yesterday, there were more than 100,000 patients hospitalized from coronavirus -- more than double the number of patients at the beginning of November. Compared to the first wave earlier in the year, where cases were mainly concentrated in the Northeast of the country, today the pandemic is being felt across the whole country. Today, the Department of Labor released its weekly unemployment report. In a positive surprise, new weekly jobless claims fell more than was expected even with the surge in coronavirus and the reimposition of stay-in-place restrictions across many states. For the week ending November 28, there were 712,000 new claims vs 775,000 expected. Continuing claims, which shows the amount of people entering their second week of jobless claims, also fell to 5.52 million vs 5.8 million estimate. Highlights Not really stock market related but we thought it was cool. Former Presidents Clinton, Bush, and Obama said they will take the COVID vaccine publicly in order to foster public trust in the vaccine. The Wall Street Journal reported that Pfizer (PFE) expect to ship only half of the vaccines it had planned in 2020 because of supply chain issues. A&T Inc's Warner Bros studio on Thursday announced that it will make all of its 2021 films available in theaters and on the HBO Max streaming service starting on the same day, an unprecedented shift in response to the coronavirus pandemic that sank shares of movie theater operators. A company founded by Tom Siebel called C3 IoT is expected to begin trading via IPO very soon, rumors are Wednesday of next week. WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department accused Facebook Inc on Thursday of discriminating against U.S. workers, saying in a new lawsuit the social media giant has given hiring preferences to temporary workers, including those who hold H-1B visas.
