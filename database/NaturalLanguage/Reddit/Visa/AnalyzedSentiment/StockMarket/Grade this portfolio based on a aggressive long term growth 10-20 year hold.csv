,,You got way too many tech stocks for long term.,0,0.564,NEGATIVE,0.993
,,"I sold 50% of NVDA, even though I believe in it long term, the valuation is pretty wild right now. Iâ€™d suggest you trim some as well. Maybe add a little BRKB with your profits. You also could get most of what you are already holding with VGT.",0,0.529,POSITIVE,0.858

,,"Tech, tech, more tech, something with payment and tech, something with payment and tech, and tech. Growth could be possibly big but for me itâ€™s a tech only portfolio tbh.6/10 bc I believe in tech.",0,0.546,POSITIVE,0.999
,,"All great companies but currently all trading rich, imo. Whatâ€™s your cost basis on each? I recommend taking profits on CSU, AAPL & MC. Iâ€™d sell all of NVDA as itâ€™s trading incredibly rich.",0,0.519,POSITIVE,0.887

,,Tell that to my 98% ytd gain.....,1,0.517,POSITIVE,0.993
,,"Not overrated, but probably want to trim some after a massive run. Also not a fan of having 40% in any one stock that is that volatile. I would shift 20% out of Nvidia and split it into Apple and Microsoft.",1,0.561,NEGATIVE,1.0

,,...I think that's what most of the large cap growth funds have? 10~20 years? Some firms might not be around in 20 yrs. I would rather put it in funds such as MGK or VIGAX.,0,0.524,NEGATIVE,0.781
,,Why Visa & MC?,0,0.502,NEGATIVE,0.975
,,"I agree. Op, having v and ma together makes no sense since theyâ€™re in the exact same business. Please pick 1. My recommendation is to keep ma.",1,0.526,NEGATIVE,0.998

,,Get rid of that NVDA and buy Tesla.,0,0.547,NEGATIVE,0.995
,,"It looks pretty good to me. If I were to point to potential adjustments, I would consider putting some of what you have in Nvidia into a growth company outside the tech sector to hedge or even capture upside during inevitable tech downturns.",0,0.568,POSITIVE,0.967

,,Terrible. QQQ to the rescue.,0,0.505,NEGATIVE,1.0
,,"Pretty bad. AAPL is totally overvalued, and NVDA is good for short squeeze, but probably not longer than 6 months. You've done the classic mistake of investing in companies you, yourself, recognize and trust, and not companies based on actual economic growth potential.",0,0.534,NEGATIVE,1.0
,,5/7,0,0.5,POSITIVE,0.999
,,"Apple is not a growth company anymore. Neither is Visa nor Mastercard. If u want growth, buy next gen tech or something in in the like Cathie woods direction. Dont act like some big cap stock is gonna triple or something. And double your money in 10-20 years is really bad. Throw in some space exploration autonomous mobility or something like this if u want real growth.",0,0.556,NEGATIVE,1.0

,,No risk no reward,0,0.497,NEGATIVE,0.987
,,"Its not diverse. Diversity in the market produces beffer risk adjusted rate of returns. Why not look a cross more sectors, markets caps, and valuations? An aggressive portfolio does not have to be 90% tech.",0,0.531,NEGATIVE,0.961
,,"If your expecting this investment to increase in value, lower your expectations.",0,0.571,NEGATIVE,0.925
,,"too sector specific and company specific... might want to be more index and 5-15% in a specific company so you can rebalance appropriately....I have 25% in one company right now, when it moves up it's great, but it has reset to 2019 levels so the portfolio as an overall is now down. also too much in one firm means you better be keeping up with them. the slightest sign that they are going to go bankrupt or have a downturn too much you'll get hit... I'd look to do a trailing stop loss limit on a $ or % basis to cover yourself.. wish I did that, which I am now starting to do on many things as part of rebalancing.",0,0.562,NEGATIVE,1.0
