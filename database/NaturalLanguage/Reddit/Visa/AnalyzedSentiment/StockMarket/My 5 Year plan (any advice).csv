(starting to like Reddit a lot more due to all the helpful advice I am getting)","I started heavily investing at 23 and am at a little over 500k NW at 30. While getting lucky on a few things, I stayed very disciplined on a lot.Here are some things I recommend earlier versus later.Have a budget. Know your expenses.Know the difference between pre tax and post tax dollars. If you want to buy something that is $1000, but your income tax is 25% you need to make $1333 in gross income to pay for the $1000 item. [1000/(1-.25)] = 1333.Invest as much early as possible. Compound interest really starts doing the heavy lifting when you have a fat principal balance working for you.If you have a 401k you must at least do the minimum to get you employers maximum match. If you don't you are leaving money off the table. If they match 50 cents on a dollar that is still an immediate 50% rate of return, compared the markets average of 7-10.Max out the 401k if possible. This one is tough if you are not a high earner, but ultimately putting more will save you on income taxes. The IRS maximum for 2024 is $23,000 annually. If your tax rate is 25% this will save you from paying roughly $5750 annually in taxes. There aren't a lot of other opportunities in life to save thousands on something if you look at it as your going to be investing anyways.Have an after-tax investment account (like your brokerage thru Schwab) in addition to a 401k. Having reserves in something you can pull out of out of versus taking a penalty on your 401k or obtaining debt is advantageous.Avoid debt outside of good debt (ex mortgages). Don't rack up credit cards, don't open up lines of credit on promos.Life well below your means.Have a plan on what you can set aside monthly. Set reasonable expectations on how that money should perform on average over a specific period of time (7-10% on your major stock indexes).Don't get scared at market corrections, don't try and time the market. Don't try and outsmart wall street. Time is your most valuable asset right now and you need to play the long game.Invest in your education. We live in a world of specialization and those who specialize in something get handsomely rewarded for it.Stay diversified in both your portfolio and life. Mental health now is more important than the difference between a few grand in an account when all your hair is grey.",0,0.521,NEGATIVE,0.545

You are way better off than I was at your age, but like you, I started investing at the age of 25 (age 56 now). Fortunately, investing has helped me pay off my 30 year mortgage, 17 years early and eliminate all CC debt. About 5 years ago when my son turned 21, we opened and investment acct for him. I told him whatever he put in, me and his mom would match. Of course he was skeptical, but I told him he 100% wouldn‚Äôt regret it. Long story short, he put in $3k and we matched it, so he started with $6k. I believe it was about 3 years later that he texted me a screenshot of his balance and it had grown to $74k. He was hooked! Lol‚Ä¶ He is an active investor in addition to his full time job. I have successfully encouraged other youngsters to start actively investing.
