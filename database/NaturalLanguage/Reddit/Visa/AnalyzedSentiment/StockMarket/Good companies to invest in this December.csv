Larger corporations understand that the longer they wait the more expensive she‚Äôll be.Nevertheless I‚Äôm very excited about AOUT trading below book value üëç. That book value is highly likely to increase after next earnings whether they beat or not. Should translate into higher share price. It also helps that management has the confidence in the company to purchase their own stock as well.
