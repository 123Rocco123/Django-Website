If you have a very large portfolio and you're going to deploy a lot of money into either of these stocks. Consider MA because it returns more to the shareholder through buy backs, which you don't have to pay taxes on. Something to consider when buying either of the two. SUMMARIZED FINANCIALS: Visa has slightly better margins, but slower profitability growth Mastercard returns more FCF on a per share basis, but the stock is also more expensive considering FCF-to-price Visa has more cash (dollar amount), better cash-debt ratio (insulated against disasters, and they have a better current ratio Mastercard has slightly higher shareholder yield (returns more to the investor through buy back and dividends) Mastercard buys back more % of the company vs. Visa gives slightly more dividends (consider tax complications with dividends) Dividend growth of both companies is almost identical.

THERE IS NO WRONG PICK!! Sources: Seeking Alpha for GAAP fundamentals, and Gurufocus non-gaap","I don't have e much to add, as I hold Visa, but am indifferent to either. I can say first hand though, Mastercard has just now rolled out a credit card in which you can pay your rent with no additional fees, and gain points to use on a variety of items. This seems like a big move that I have not heard talked about yet. The card is called Bilt. I work in property management and we just rolled it out to all our properties which is about 2,000 units. I imagine this will equate to large customer base growth and could be a good time to buy. I have not heard of a Visa competitor to it yet.",0,0.521,NEGATIVE,0.998
