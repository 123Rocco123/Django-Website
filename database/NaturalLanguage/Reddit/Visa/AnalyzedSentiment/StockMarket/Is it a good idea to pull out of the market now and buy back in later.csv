Would selling out now and re-buying later when they are lower be a good option?","This might not be bottom quite yet, but the markets taken a massive hit. I would consider now to be a good time to buy. In the short term you could see some losses if we're not at the bottom, but long term I think it would be a good move.It's also worth considering that markets nearly always overreact to bad news.",0,0.543,POSITIVE,0.944

Buy great companies, hold them forever, sell if your investment thesis no longer applies to the situation. Repeat.The statistics are so very clear. On average, don't sell, hold long term. You won't be able to time the market.Say you sell. When do you buy in? I guarantee you that anyone with any knowledge in the markets can pick apart any answer.Good luck!",0,0.542,NEGATIVE,0.992

Would selling out now and re-buying later when they are lower be a good option?","It's usually better to hold long term. Holding just about any stock for 30 years would have almost always made you money. Not always, but generally. Lots of people sold stocks for a loss after 2008 and bought back in later. They paid a lot of fees, caused themselves a lot of stress and eventually bought back in. Many who held recovered losses quicker than expected and starting seeing profits again.

The only ones getting rich with frequent trading are the brokers. If you believe the investments you made then were sound, they will give you returns better than most other investment instruments when you cash them out after a few decades. If you want to get rich overnight, you’ll most likely end up being on the losing side, this is a long game to play. As far as selling now is concerned? No! Rather set aside some funds and buy some stocks monthly or quarterly when everyone is fearing. Sale is going on! Also, please read The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham. The best book I’ve ever read although the principles were established decades ago they still hold today and will keep true all the time. Buy Low, Sell High!",0,0.54,POSITIVE,0.792

Would selling out now and re-buying later when they are lower be a good option?","My advice is to look at the companies you invest in and question, “Are these profitable, will they continue to be profitable, and is this company safe to invest in overall”. In reality the US economy is very healthy, thriving businesses, low unemployment, and aside from a few hiccups, the market has been doing very well.To add to this, I do not believe a trade war will ensue (of course I may be wrong), but If the world is really concerned about the economic impacts of these tariffs, they will offer to negotiate, something Trump loves to do! If he is smart (which is very questionable), these tariffs are more or less sending a message that the US will no longer be taken advantage of economically and not actually about imposing lots of tariffs to make the rest of the world market suffer. Ultimately this should be a good thing for the US economy, instead of continuing to lose pace with the rest of the world.To top it off, US businesses have had a sort of stimulus with this years tax cuts along with the bull market. Interest rates have also been raised, and this is good because if there is a down turn, they can be lowered which should dissuade an economic downturn if needed.Lastly, Trump can be wrangled in if it gets out of hand, believe it or not. And it is also in the worlds best interest for the US economy to do well, so if a trade was does occur, it will be hurting everyone, so it would not be in anyone’s best interest to actually escalate things to the point of crippling the world economy.Feel free to call out my logic, I am a novice investor, but I feel this is generally correct.",0,0.535,POSITIVE,0.824
