,,"As sudden & dramatic as today's move felt/seemed, volume was still comparatively very light.IMHO: normal profit taking after a pretty remarkable move + prolonged overbought condition...done by institutions selling what they could get away with (e.g. prevent a volume spike)",0,0.52,NEGATIVE,0.999

,,"Only 50 million shares were traded over the course of the day -- until the final hour or so that is. 10-day avg is 83 million; today was 95 million. While yes, that is above the 10-day avg, 95 million is nothing compared to real""flush"" events when institutions put on sell programs that run all day long and in excess of 150 million shares.Will it continue to EOY? I doubt it. But it could. I've certainly been wrong plenty of times before! IMHO this was an institution selling what they could, maybe a few others joined in. If light volume returns, there is typically a neutral-to-positive biasModerate &/or heavy volume does not work ""inverse"" to light volume; it does not have a negative bias. It only suggests, IMHO, to what level institutions are involved...hence why I said an institution or a few institutions selling but keeping their selling under the threshold of a volume spike.Given the move we've made, horizontal consolidation (e.g. bull flag) or a pullback would actually be a healthy thing for continued upside that goes thru & stays above ATHs. I personally do not see that happening, but like I said above: I've been wrong plenty of times before!",2,0.548,NEGATIVE,1.0

I see the recent rally as dumb money from domestic and foreign investors rolling like a wave into the broad index ETFs. This helps to explain low volume because these funds add securities through futures rather than trading on the market directly. The objective truth right now is that the DOW 30 are richly valued. There's not been enough volume behind that to make me believe the multiples we see right now will be sticky.
