These holdings are not owned by Bank of America but rather their customers. So are these holdings simply what customers of BofA are investing in and we're seeing the high level view of their choices? That would explain why they seem to hold a lot of overlapping positions (i.e. multiple ETFs tracking the same thing). It would also explain why Apple, MSFT, and other well known ETFs are at the top since most people put these companies in their personal portfolios (strong balance sheet and dividends).Or am I wrong and this is a portfolio that they created for their clients? I would have a hard time believing that since there are so many positions and many overlap.",0,0.529,NEGATIVE,0.979
,"Before we get started, I want to point out a couple of things. First, this list is ordered by highest-lowest market value. Second, the pie chart below only accounts for the top 50 highest market value holdings. Third, this post was created using SEC 13F filings. The SEC 13F filings list can be found [here](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/bank-of-america-corp-de) What are SEC 13F Filings? TLDR; ""The Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) Form 13F is a quarterly report that is required to be filed by all institutional investment managers with at least $100 million in assets under management. It discloses their equity holdings and can help smaller investors determine what the ""smart money"" is doing in the market. However, studies have found that 13F filings also have serious flaws and can't be taken at face value.""

,"Before we get started, I want to point out a couple of things. First, this list is ordered by highest-lowest market value. Second, the pie chart below only accounts for the top 50 highest market value holdings. Third, this post was created using SEC 13F filings. The SEC 13F filings list can be found [here](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/bank-of-america-corp-de) What are SEC 13F Filings? TLDR; ""The Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) Form 13F is a quarterly report that is required to be filed by all institutional investment managers with at least $100 million in assets under management. It discloses their equity holdings and can help smaller investors determine what the ""smart money"" is doing in the market. However, studies have found that 13F filings also have serious flaws and can't be taken at face value.""
