,"PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, January 13, 2021 Stocks rose modestly on Wednesday after trading choppily in the morning as market participants continue to look ahead to the policy implication of the incoming Democratic administration. The S&P 500 (SPY) finished the day 0.25% up, the Nasdaq (QQQ) finished 0.68%, and the Dow Jones (DIA) finished 0.05% down. With the S&P 500 near-record levels, it seems market participants have largely looked past the recent political unrest in Washington and are looking ahead to the policy implications of the incoming Democratic Senate and Presidential administration. After last week’s riots at the Capitol building, the House of Representatives is preparing to vote later today over whether to impeach President Trump for the second time for “inciting an insurrection”. While there seems to be support for impeachment proceedings in Washington, some lawmakers have warned that the trial could pull focus away from President-elect Biden’s agenda in his first days in office. Under the incoming unified Democratic government, market participants and analysts are expecting that another large stimulus package will be passed in the not-to-distant future. The prospects for additional stimulus and the Federal Reserve’s commitment to maintaining its asset purchasing program has buoyed markets in recent weeks amid the surging coronavirus pandemic and the slow vaccine rollout. Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard said during an interview with the Wall Street Journal, “We want to get through the pandemic and sort of see where the dust settles, then we will be able to think about where to go with balance-sheet policy”. Yesterday, the US reported its highest number of coronavirus deaths in one day with 4,327, according to Johns Hopkins University. In fact, the five highest daily tallies for new infections and deaths have all occurred in 2021, according to CNN, meaning the virus is spreading and killing faster now than at any point in 2020. According to Johns Hopkins University, over the past week, the US has averaged more than 3,300 daily deaths, a jump of around 217% compared to mid-November.

,"PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, January 13, 2021 Stocks rose modestly on Wednesday after trading choppily in the morning as market participants continue to look ahead to the policy implication of the incoming Democratic administration. The S&P 500 (SPY) finished the day 0.25% up, the Nasdaq (QQQ) finished 0.68%, and the Dow Jones (DIA) finished 0.05% down. With the S&P 500 near-record levels, it seems market participants have largely looked past the recent political unrest in Washington and are looking ahead to the policy implications of the incoming Democratic Senate and Presidential administration. After last week’s riots at the Capitol building, the House of Representatives is preparing to vote later today over whether to impeach President Trump for the second time for “inciting an insurrection”. While there seems to be support for impeachment proceedings in Washington, some lawmakers have warned that the trial could pull focus away from President-elect Biden’s agenda in his first days in office. Under the incoming unified Democratic government, market participants and analysts are expecting that another large stimulus package will be passed in the not-to-distant future. The prospects for additional stimulus and the Federal Reserve’s commitment to maintaining its asset purchasing program has buoyed markets in recent weeks amid the surging coronavirus pandemic and the slow vaccine rollout. Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard said during an interview with the Wall Street Journal, “We want to get through the pandemic and sort of see where the dust settles, then we will be able to think about where to go with balance-sheet policy”. Yesterday, the US reported its highest number of coronavirus deaths in one day with 4,327, according to Johns Hopkins University. In fact, the five highest daily tallies for new infections and deaths have all occurred in 2021, according to CNN, meaning the virus is spreading and killing faster now than at any point in 2020. According to Johns Hopkins University, over the past week, the US has averaged more than 3,300 daily deaths, a jump of around 217% compared to mid-November. Highlights Gamestop (GME) took off like a rocket today! After removal from Amazon (AMZN) Web Services’ servers and Apple (AAPL) and Google’s app stores, Parler’s CEO warned that the platform may not return.
