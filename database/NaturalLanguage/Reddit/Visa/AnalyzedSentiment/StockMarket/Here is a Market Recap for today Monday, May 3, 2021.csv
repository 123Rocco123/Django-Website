,"PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, May 3, 2021 Stocks traded mixed, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) ticking higher while the tech-Nasdaq (QQQ) declined. The SPY rose 5% in April, for the best performance since November of last year. Following a rotation into cyclical and reopening stocks at the beginning of the year, April saw the communication services and consumer discretionary sectors lead gains in the SPY, returning to the leadership position. Growth stocks continued underperforming, paring recent gains after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said some sectors of the market appeared “frothy”. Looking ahead, market participants continue to monitor corporate earnings and wait for more economic data, particularly the April jobs report that will be released May 7th. A wave of stronger-than-expected earnings, especially in banks and mega-caps like Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT), have fueled the latest rally in the market. In the US, effective distribution of the vaccine and the gradual reopening of the economy have led to a surge in consumer spending, driving corporate profits way past analyst estimates. As of Friday, 86% of S&P 500 companies had beaten first-quarter earnings expectations, according to FactSet data. This would mark the highest proportion since at least 2008, if the current rate holds through the end of first-quarter earnings season. The Labor Department will release its April jobs report on Friday, which is expected to show a staggering nearly 1 million payrolls came back last month, accelerating March’s gain. As a reminder, in March, the Department of Labor reported nonfarm payrolls increased by 916,000 for the month while the unemployment rate fell to 6% (unemployment rate was 14.6% in April 2020). Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 675,000 and an unemployment rate of 6%. Last week, President Biden addressed a joint session of Congress, during which he said “America was back on the move again” following the coronavirus pandemic.. In his address, President Biden touted his $2 trillion infrastructure plan and unveiled a new $1.8 trillion proposal aimed at supporting children, students, and families. This proposal, called the American Families Plan, would be funded in part with the newly proposed tax increases on the wealthy. Read the details of the proposal here. Highlights As of Sunday, more than 104 million Americans were fully vaccinated, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly ⅓ of the entire population. Legendary investor Warren Buffet spoke at Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting. There were a lot of takeaways, we encourage everyone to check it out. Shares of Uber, Lyft and Doordash (DASH) fell sharply after Reuters reported that Labor Secretary Marty Walsh supported reclassifying gig workers as employees. This change would give workers additional benefits at a large cost to companies. Recall the battle last year over Proposition 22 in California, which eventually passed in favor of companies in the gig-economy. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said that NYC would open with full capacity beginning July 1. ""Our plan is to fully reopen on July 1. We are ready for stores to open, for businesses to open, offices, theaters, full strength,” de Blasio said. Twitter (TWTR)said on Monday it will introduce a new feature to let users charge admission to their live audio chat rooms in its ""Spaces"" feature, as the social media company seeks to court more content creators. Starting on Monday, any user with at least 600 followers can be a host, the company added. Cathie Wood's Ark Investment Management bought about 1.3 million shares of Twitter Inc worth $71 million last week after the stock fell on disappointing earnings results compared to peers. Penn National Gaming (PENN) announced it is launching Penn Game Studios, which will create exclusive iCasino content for its customers with an in-house development team. **Please note that current stock price was written in the morning and does not reflect intraday movement** Apple (AAPL) target raised by Morgan Stanley from $158 to $161 at Overweight.
