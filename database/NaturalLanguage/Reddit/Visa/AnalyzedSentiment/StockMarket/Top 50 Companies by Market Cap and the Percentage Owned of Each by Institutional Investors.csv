,"Not sure if this is helpful at all or if anyone cares, but since has been all the rage for the past ~14 months and has recently been included in the S&P 500, I checked to see what % of it was held by institutional investors, and how that compares with the other 49 of the largest companies by market cap in the world. Some findings: 39.77% of Tesla is held by institutional investors. This places it #43 out of 50, and #42 out of 44 American companies. The only American companies on the top 50 with a lower percentage of itself owned by institutional investors are Wal-Mart and Berkshire Hathaway Class A shares. The overall average is 61.57%. For the United States, it's slightly higher at 67.36%, and for international companies, of which there are only 7, the average is much lower at 19.16%. The lowest is Toyota, with only 1.11% owned by institutional investors. The highest is Visa, with 92.76%.

It's been speculated that benchmark funds did not buy at the same time as tracking funds. The stock price movement on TSLA this week is a result of that. People expect a dump after inclusion day. It didn't come. No dump coming this time either.,0,0.536,NEGATIVE,1.0

I know I can probably Google this, but when do the filings come out?Also, when you're saying benchmark vs tracking funds, do you mean those that largely mirror a benchmark like the S&P 500 but can be weight differently (e.g. Overweight TSLA, Underweight JPM) and those that attempt to track an index as precisely as possible?",1,0.515,POSITIVE,0.93
