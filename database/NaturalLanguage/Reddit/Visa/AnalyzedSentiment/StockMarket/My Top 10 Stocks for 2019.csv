Even after a good run-up, I might see a drop to below my initial buy-in. I've kept some long term records, and pretty much across the board, the SP500 seems to have beaten almost all of them.Look, I realize the SPY and VOO are subject to the same forces, but just so everyone knows, picking based on analysis is hard and even harder is having the resources to stick with picks when your real money is at stake.So my advice is to invest all you can as young as you can and don't touch it. Let your sensible picks be at least diversified and with money you can let sit forever. Maybe you'll get lucky. Few of us can see and interact like Buffett.
