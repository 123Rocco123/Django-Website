Card companies make money on ""volume"" and ""debt rolled over in next billing cycle"" (feeses and other standard charges make a small part of their revenues).Now the data you are looking for is average credit card debt per person in the US vs Canada. US is somewhere around $6000 and Canada is $3000. US is double the amount.Next point you are looking for is the interest rate. Canada is regulated and govt can control the interest rates on the card if they go out of hand. Don't get me started what the rates are in the US.Next point is the length of the debt. People in this country roll over debt for longer years as compared to any country in the world. Longer you keep the debt, more the interest you pay and more moeny credit companies make.Also card companies in the US have relaxed regulations when it comes to offering credit (not just credit card but mortgages, car loans etc). One of the big reasons the financial crisis happened was people who had no fixed invome had credit lines open to them and they were spending left right and center.I can do this all day.
