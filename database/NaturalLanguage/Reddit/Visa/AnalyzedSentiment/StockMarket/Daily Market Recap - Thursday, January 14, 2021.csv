,"PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, January 14, 2021 After the Dow and Nasdaq briefly reached new intraday highs, the stock market pared its gains to end slightly lower today. Market participants continue to monitor the political situation in Washington D.C. and the coronavirus pandemic. In Washington, members of the House of Representatives, including 10 Republicans, voted to impeach Donald Trump for the second time, making him the only president in history to be impeached twice. Current Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he would not call back members of the Senate back into session early before January 19 to hold the impeachment trial. This suggests Trump will serve out his remaining time in office before President-Elect Biden takes over. The trial, which accuses Trump of “inciting an insurrection” can still take place after he leaves office. Despite early warnings from analysts that a unified Democratic government would be bad for the market, the market has performed remarkably well since Biden’s victory. It seems the prospect of additional fiscal relief under the Democrats and the Federal Reserve’s commitment to keeping rates low and maintaining its program of asset purchasing have buoyed equities despite the surging coronavirus pandemic. Later today, President-Elect Biden is expected to unveil some of the details of an additional virus-relief package. Jason Ware, chief investment officer for Albion Financial Group said, “As we look at the new administration in Washington and a Congress that’s tilted toward the Democrats, we do expect more stimulus to come down the line. It’s probably not going to happen over the next couple of weeks, but certainly, by the spring an extension of unemployment benefits for those who are still out of work, maybe a boost to what they’re getting on a weekly basis, and fresh stimulus checks closer to $2,000 might be something that has an appetite in Washington.” The Trump administration announced sweeping changes to its vaccination rollout on Tuesday, including making all of the coronavirus vaccine supply immediately available, urging states to provide shots to anyone 65 and older, and warning states with lagging inoculations that they could lose some of their shots to speedier places. The plan is an effort to speed up the rollout of the vaccine, which has so far lagged behind promises. The US recorded 3,848 deaths on Wednesday, down from an all-time high of 4,327 the day before, according to Johns Hopkins University. The nation now has over 23.2 million infections and a death toll of over 385,000. Highlights Tesla’s quarterly safety report shows fewer accidents per mil when a car is using autopilot. Petco (WOOF) spikes 65% on its first day of trading. Will be interesting to see how the stock holds up moving forwards. Poshmark (POSH) spiked more than 140% in its first day of trading. Amid global shortages of semiconductors ranging from chips for autos to graphics processors, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) said early Thursday it plans to spend $28 billion to increase the capacity of its plants. Cathie Woods, the extremely successful fund manager from ARK is launching a new space etf. Our two favorite space plays, Virgin Galactic (SPCE) and Stable Road Acquisition (SRAC) were up double digits today. Ticker is going to be ARKX Following regulatory scrutiny, Google (GOOG) has finished the acquisition of Fitbit for around $2.1 billion. AMD target raised by Cowen from $100 to $110 at Outperform.
