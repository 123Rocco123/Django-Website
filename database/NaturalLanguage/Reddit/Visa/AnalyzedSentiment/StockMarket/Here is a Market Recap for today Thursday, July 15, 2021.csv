,"PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, July 15, 2021 Stocks broadly fell today as market participants continued digesting Q2 earning reports, reassurances from the Federal Reserve that current inflationary pressures is temporary and new economic reports that suggest a slowdown in the global growth rate. After recording several new intraday highs this week, the S&P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) slipped, closing 0.34% and 0.7% down respectively. The Russell 2000 (IWM) fell for the third straight day this week, closing 0.54% down. Markets seem to have become jittery following the release of the June Consumer and Producer Price Index (CPI & PPI). (CPI), which measures changes in the prices of consumer goods, rose 0.9% in June, accelerating from May’s 0.6%. Year-on-year, the CPI is up 5.4%, exceeding the 4.9% expected by economists and the fastest rate of growth since 2008. Core CPI, which excludes the volatile price energy and food and is therefore considered a more accurate representation of general price inflation, was up 4.5% year-on-year as prices bounced from last year’s pandemic-era lows. PPI, which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output rose 1% in June, accelerating to a 7.3% rise year-on-year, while still reflecting base effects. Core PPI rse 5.5%. This is the fastest rate of increase since 2009. Yesterday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave his semi-annual monetary policy testimony before Congress, where he largely reiterated the same thing he has been saying for months. Powell said “inflation will likely remain elevated in the coming months before moderating” and that the US economy was “still a ways” off from reaching the threshold of “substantial further progress” that would trigger the Central Bank to roll-back pandemic-era policies. In short, Powell basically said while he expects higher inflation prints in the coming months, pressures are transitory and due to pandemic era disruptions and the Fed’s goal for economic recovery have not been met. Here is Powell’s complete testimony, but here are two of his most important quotes. On the labor market: “Conditions in the labor market have continued to improve, but there is still a long way to go. Labor demand appears to be very strong; job openings are at a record high, hiring is robust, and many workers are leaving their current jobs to search for better ones. Indeed, employers added 1.7 million workers from April through June. However, the unemployment rate remained elevated in June at 5.9 percent, and this figure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market has not moved up from the low rates that have prevailed for most of the past year. Job gains should be strong in coming months as public health conditions continue to improve and as some of the other pandemic-related factors currently weighing them down diminish.” On inflation: “Inflation has increased notably and will likely remain elevated in coming months before moderating. Inflation is being temporarily boosted by base effects, as the sharp pandemic-related price declines from last spring drop out of the 12-month calculation. In addition, strong demand in sectors where production bottlenecks or other supply constraints have limited production has led to especially rapid price increases for some goods and services, which should partially reverse as the effects of the bottlenecks unwind. Prices for services that were hard hit by the pandemic have also jumped in recent months as demand for these services has surged with the reopening of the economy”. In other news, new economic data coming out of China, the first country to experience and begin recovering from the virus, is showing a marked slowdown in economic growth. The world's second largest economy expanded at a 7.9% rate in the second quarter from a year ago, according to the National Bureau of Statistics, missing consensus estimates for an 8.0% rise and decelerating sharply from the first quarter's 18.3% increase. In response, the People’s Bank of China signalled it was cutting the amount of cash that banks must hold in reserve, a move that suggests the economic recovery in China may be slowing down. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) will reduce the reserve requirement ratio by 0.5 percentage point for most banks, according to a statement published Friday. That will unleash about 1 trillion yuan ($154 billion) of long-term liquidity into the economy and will be effective on July 15, the central bank said. The reduction was signaled earlier this week, when the State Council, China’s equivalent of a cabinet, hinted the central bank would make more liquidity available to banks so they could lend to smaller firms hurt by rising costs. The timing and magnitude of the move, coming a week before second-quarter growth data, suggests worries about the economy’s outlook and was a decisive shift away from policy tightening, which most, if not all, recovering economies are pursuing. Just to put into more familiar terms, this would be like if the Federal Reserve suddenly turned around and said rather than discussing tapering quantitative easing, it would instead propose pumping more money into the economy.

,"PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, July 15, 2021 Stocks broadly fell today as market participants continued digesting Q2 earning reports, reassurances from the Federal Reserve that current inflationary pressures is temporary and new economic reports that suggest a slowdown in the global growth rate. After recording several new intraday highs this week, the S&P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) slipped, closing 0.34% and 0.7% down respectively. The Russell 2000 (IWM) fell for the third straight day this week, closing 0.54% down. Markets seem to have become jittery following the release of the June Consumer and Producer Price Index (CPI & PPI). (CPI), which measures changes in the prices of consumer goods, rose 0.9% in June, accelerating from May’s 0.6%. Year-on-year, the CPI is up 5.4%, exceeding the 4.9% expected by economists and the fastest rate of growth since 2008. Core CPI, which excludes the volatile price energy and food and is therefore considered a more accurate representation of general price inflation, was up 4.5% year-on-year as prices bounced from last year’s pandemic-era lows. PPI, which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output rose 1% in June, accelerating to a 7.3% rise year-on-year, while still reflecting base effects. Core PPI rse 5.5%. This is the fastest rate of increase since 2009. Yesterday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave his semi-annual monetary policy testimony before Congress, where he largely reiterated the same thing he has been saying for months. Powell said “inflation will likely remain elevated in the coming months before moderating” and that the US economy was “still a ways” off from reaching the threshold of “substantial further progress” that would trigger the Central Bank to roll-back pandemic-era policies. In short, Powell basically said while he expects higher inflation prints in the coming months, pressures are transitory and due to pandemic era disruptions and the Fed’s goal for economic recovery have not been met. Here is Powell’s complete testimony, but here are two of his most important quotes. On the labor market: “Conditions in the labor market have continued to improve, but there is still a long way to go. Labor demand appears to be very strong; job openings are at a record high, hiring is robust, and many workers are leaving their current jobs to search for better ones. Indeed, employers added 1.7 million workers from April through June. However, the unemployment rate remained elevated in June at 5.9 percent, and this figure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market has not moved up from the low rates that have prevailed for most of the past year. Job gains should be strong in coming months as public health conditions continue to improve and as some of the other pandemic-related factors currently weighing them down diminish.” On inflation: “Inflation has increased notably and will likely remain elevated in coming months before moderating. Inflation is being temporarily boosted by base effects, as the sharp pandemic-related price declines from last spring drop out of the 12-month calculation. In addition, strong demand in sectors where production bottlenecks or other supply constraints have limited production has led to especially rapid price increases for some goods and services, which should partially reverse as the effects of the bottlenecks unwind. Prices for services that were hard hit by the pandemic have also jumped in recent months as demand for these services has surged with the reopening of the economy”. In other news, new economic data coming out of China, the first country to experience and begin recovering from the virus, is showing a marked slowdown in economic growth. The world's second largest economy expanded at a 7.9% rate in the second quarter from a year ago, according to the National Bureau of Statistics, missing consensus estimates for an 8.0% rise and decelerating sharply from the first quarter's 18.3% increase. In response, the People’s Bank of China signalled it was cutting the amount of cash that banks must hold in reserve, a move that suggests the economic recovery in China may be slowing down. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) will reduce the reserve requirement ratio by 0.5 percentage point for most banks, according to a statement published Friday. That will unleash about 1 trillion yuan ($154 billion) of long-term liquidity into the economy and will be effective on July 15, the central bank said. The reduction was signaled earlier this week, when the State Council, China’s equivalent of a cabinet, hinted the central bank would make more liquidity available to banks so they could lend to smaller firms hurt by rising costs. The timing and magnitude of the move, coming a week before second-quarter growth data, suggests worries about the economy’s outlook and was a decisive shift away from policy tightening, which most, if not all, recovering economies are pursuing. Just to put into more familiar terms, this would be like if the Federal Reserve suddenly turned around and said rather than discussing tapering quantitative easing, it would instead propose pumping more money into the economy.

In response, the People’s Bank of China signalled it was cutting the amount of cash that banks must hold in reserve, a move that suggests the economic recovery in China may be slowing down. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) will reduce the reserve requirement ratio by 0.5 percentage point for most banks, according to a statement published Friday. That will unleash about 1 trillion yuan ($154 billion) of long-term liquidity into the economy and will be effective on July 15, the central bank said. The reduction was signaled earlier this week, when the State Council, China’s equivalent of a cabinet, hinted the central bank would make more liquidity available to banks so they could lend to smaller firms hurt by rising costs. The timing and magnitude of the move, coming a week before second-quarter growth data, suggests worries about the economy’s outlook and was a decisive shift away from policy tightening, which most, if not all, recovering economies are pursuing. Just to put into more familiar terms, this would be like if the Federal Reserve suddenly turned around and said rather than discussing tapering quantitative easing, it would instead propose pumping more money into the economy.

,"PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, July 15, 2021 Stocks broadly fell today as market participants continued digesting Q2 earning reports, reassurances from the Federal Reserve that current inflationary pressures is temporary and new economic reports that suggest a slowdown in the global growth rate. After recording several new intraday highs this week, the S&P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) slipped, closing 0.34% and 0.7% down respectively. The Russell 2000 (IWM) fell for the third straight day this week, closing 0.54% down. Markets seem to have become jittery following the release of the June Consumer and Producer Price Index (CPI & PPI). (CPI), which measures changes in the prices of consumer goods, rose 0.9% in June, accelerating from May’s 0.6%. Year-on-year, the CPI is up 5.4%, exceeding the 4.9% expected by economists and the fastest rate of growth since 2008. Core CPI, which excludes the volatile price energy and food and is therefore considered a more accurate representation of general price inflation, was up 4.5% year-on-year as prices bounced from last year’s pandemic-era lows. PPI, which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output rose 1% in June, accelerating to a 7.3% rise year-on-year, while still reflecting base effects. Core PPI rse 5.5%. This is the fastest rate of increase since 2009. Yesterday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave his semi-annual monetary policy testimony before Congress, where he largely reiterated the same thing he has been saying for months. Powell said “inflation will likely remain elevated in the coming months before moderating” and that the US economy was “still a ways” off from reaching the threshold of “substantial further progress” that would trigger the Central Bank to roll-back pandemic-era policies. In short, Powell basically said while he expects higher inflation prints in the coming months, pressures are transitory and due to pandemic era disruptions and the Fed’s goal for economic recovery have not been met. Here is Powell’s complete testimony, but here are two of his most important quotes. On the labor market: “Conditions in the labor market have continued to improve, but there is still a long way to go. Labor demand appears to be very strong; job openings are at a record high, hiring is robust, and many workers are leaving their current jobs to search for better ones. Indeed, employers added 1.7 million workers from April through June. However, the unemployment rate remained elevated in June at 5.9 percent, and this figure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market has not moved up from the low rates that have prevailed for most of the past year. Job gains should be strong in coming months as public health conditions continue to improve and as some of the other pandemic-related factors currently weighing them down diminish.” On inflation: “Inflation has increased notably and will likely remain elevated in coming months before moderating. Inflation is being temporarily boosted by base effects, as the sharp pandemic-related price declines from last spring drop out of the 12-month calculation. In addition, strong demand in sectors where production bottlenecks or other supply constraints have limited production has led to especially rapid price increases for some goods and services, which should partially reverse as the effects of the bottlenecks unwind. Prices for services that were hard hit by the pandemic have also jumped in recent months as demand for these services has surged with the reopening of the economy”.
