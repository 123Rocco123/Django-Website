When whether you get it very low or very super low either way it'll rise again in your lifetime making me plenty of money. Do they imply that you can earn more money if you wait for it to be near its lowest point?The key is not to try and time the market. If you go looking for the market bottom even after a 20% plunge from all-time highs, you're still taking a big risk. It's safer wait for signs of stabilization or even recovery, even if that means missing out on some of the upswing.This mostly applies if you're looking to invest a large chunk of your cash reserves at once. If you're dollar cost averaging into the market -- say, investing $500/month instead of dumping an entire $5000 into the market right away, then you take a good chunk of the downside risk out of it (but not all of it by any means).With this coronavirus giving all these discounted stocks, would it be wise to wait it out a bit more or keep an eye on the news and invest accordingly over this next year?A stock is only ""discounted"" if it is considered to be below the market value of the company. We are at the very end of the longest bull market in history and there is ample evidence that economic activity is being heavily affected by the coronavirus outbreak, which could easily lead to a worldwide recession if it continues for more than a few more weeks. I would be very cautious about any claims that you can pick up ""all these discounted stocks"" at a bargain price right now. There are definitely some companies out there which will rebound nicely, but there's no guarantee a recovery will be fast or as broadly based as the last 10 years. There's no substitute for doing your research.When the market crash and it begins to rise again, will it be a steady rise or a sharp drastic high increase on the overall market.No one knows that. Depends entirely on what happens with the economy. It took five years for the DJIA to make new highs after the pre-financial crisis peaks in 2007.

This is a bad idea imo because instead of missing the bottom you may miss the rally back up. Instead, I would simply invest a set amount regularly so you don’t get stuck at too high of a position if it continues to drop, or miss the gains entirely if it begins to rally. This is a strategy called dollar cost averaging if you want to look it up.3. Nobody knows. I’d imagine it would be many rally’s that would appear drastic in the moment, but would be a steady increase if you zoom out. But again, nobody knows.4. My plan is to simply continue to buy and hold. Fortunately, I’ve been putting cash to the side for this exact event (a decline) and now I’m using the dollar cost averaging technique to steadily put that cash into the market and lower my position.5. Personally I stick to a simple ETF portfolio, so I’m in no position to give thoughts on the individual stock picks. But generally, if you put your money in well established company’s with a good reputation and history, and place in the market going forward, I’d imagine you’d be alright. I would just say diversify across sectors.I’m not sure how this is all gonna turn out. I’d imagine we’ll be seeing the corona virus blow over by the end of summer, but I’m no expert on disease control. Apparently it’s pretty nasty, so who knows, this may be the start of the next pandemic. Should be an interesting time to say the least.",0,0.524,NEGATIVE,1.0

When whether you get it very low or very super low either way it'll rise again in your lifetime making me plenty of money. Do they imply that you can earn more money if you wait for it to be near its lowest point? You don't know that, actually. The reason why you don't buy the dip is because once momentum shifts downward, you have no idea when it will bottom out. Most people buy the dip and ride their losses close to the ground. It's a foolish way to invest or speculate. You should learn the fundamentals of technical analysis and wait for momentum to reverse to the upside before putting money in. This is the optimal way to buy at a discount without getting wrecked.With this coronavirus giving all these discounted stocks, would it be wise to wait it out a bit more or keep an eye on the news and invest accordingly over this next year? Indeed, wait for now until Covid-19 cases peak. This virus is a black swan and it will either need to burn itself out (peak/decline) or be successfully contained for the markets to move past it. Until this happens, you will continue to see wild swings with the trend firmly in the decline.When the market crash and it begins to rise again, will it be a steady rise or a sharp drastic high increase on the overall market. Nobody knows this. There are too many variables. Many people seem to think it will be a V shaped recovery but I think they are wrong. We were already late in the business cycle and the Covid-19 outbreak has made the cracks in our economy to get bigger and bigger.What are your plans for investing into stocks while this coronavirus is going on?
