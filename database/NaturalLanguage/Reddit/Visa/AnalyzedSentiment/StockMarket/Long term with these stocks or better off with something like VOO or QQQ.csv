,"Ive put together a list of stocks for a portfolio I that planning on investing and then wont touch for about 5 years until I need the money. There are other stocks that I could add in as well but its pretty much the same type as the ones listed, mix of dividend and growth. I am wondering if making my own is pointless and the difference between investing in something like VOO or QQQ wont matter signficiantly at all. Thoughts? and if you think I should go with my own portfolio, what would you add/remove?

It makes life that much simpler and you'd get similar return anyway. You could throw it all into VOO for the simplest of portfolios (this is actually what Warren Buffett recommends most people do). Or do a mixture of VOO + QQQ + ICLN (since you have it listed). This way you don't have to think about anything and you are less likely to mess up.",0,0.515,NEGATIVE,0.535

If not, I would suggest building a core portfolio in tax-sheltered retirement account(s) of index ETFs. VOO and QQQ are two great ones. I also like ARK ETFs for broad exposure to more disruptive, but more risky, companies. SMH and QCLN are good ones to look into if you want sector exposure in semis and clean energy (which I think will be hot sectors during the next decade). Once you have grown those accts then maybe consider starting your own portfolio of individual stocks.However, this is pretty boring and doesn't keep you as engaged with the markets because you don't really need to research or keep tabs on anything. If you want to stay active, then maybe have a smaller personal brokerage account where you can buy some of these individual stocks and continue learning about investing. I think continuing to learn about the markets is essential, so having an individual stock portfolio might motivate you to stay engaged.As for your list of stocks, if you are young, I would lean more toward the growth stocks and take out the slower moving dividend stocks. This theoretically gives you a better chance at achieving higher returns over the next 5-10 years of holding the stocks. However, if you are risk-averse and/or will definitely take the money out in 5 years, then dividend stocks might be a ""safer"" route, though all stock investments carry some inherent risk.So, after writing all of this (which might help some new investors so I'll just leave it here), I realized that maybe you are just talking about putting money into a personal brokerage acct for 5 years and then taking it out (to buy a home or something?). In that case, I would say don't do anything too risky and just stick with VOO and QQQ so that you carry less risk than you would with a group of hand-picked stocks. If you want to be more aggressive, maybe consider putting some funds into a few ARK ETFs because those will most likely beat the market during the next 5 years given that they invest in cutting edge companies that are becoming more relevant.Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor and this is not professional financial advice. These are ideas for you to consider as you make your own decisions about what to do with your money. (Felt like I had to say that for some reason) Good luck!",0,0.533,NEGATIVE,1.0

It sort of is VW at a discount, pays a nice Dividend and with owning some VW shares they also have some smaller companies in their portfolio",0,0.529,NEGATIVE,0.985
