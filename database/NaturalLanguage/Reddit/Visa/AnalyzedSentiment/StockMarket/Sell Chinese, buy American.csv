,"I have been holding Alibaba for about 1 year and NIO a little less than a year. The Chinese government/stocks worry me a bit, so should I see both for a loss (-700 for BABA and -70 for NIO) and buy more of the following companies: NVIDIA (currently only have 2 shares but want to load up) Visa (currently have 8 shares) Microsoft (currently have 3 shares) Or possibly buy into some new companies (what are some other good companies with great potential?)

Once regulatory FUD blows over, Chinese stocks will regress to their historical P/E’s and expectations. I wouldn’t sell BABA, but NIO has its own valuation concerns outside of regulatory risk pricing in",0,0.524,NEGATIVE,0.965

Any thoughts/insight on this?",The upsides of those legit businesses are massive. Alibaba and JD.com both have over $100 billion in annual revenue and an essentially unlimited marketplace to pull from. Tencent being forced to divest some of their assets is a slightly harsher version of what’s been considered for Facebook by the SEC/Congress to force them to divest Instagram. Yes the Chinese government is ruthless. But these regulatory risks are not new. China has done this exact same thing before. Alibaba has been threatened to be delisted multiple times before. This is simply a cycle that the Chinese government will settle down once they’ve shown they’re not afraid to wield their political power.,2,0.515,NEGATIVE,1.0
