,"One of the biggest pieces of business news last week was that OnlyFans was going to bar sexually explicit videos starting from October. After the initial uproar and wave of memes, there was a lot of discussion around why a company whose main income stream is from adult content decided to kill its golden goose. Was it because they are idiots, or because of any new regulations, or is there something much larger at play here? For this week’s analysis, I would be focusing on the company’s history and my take on why they did what they did and future implications for them. So, strap in while I take one for the team with my search history and ad recommendations going into questionable territory for the considerable future. The Company OnlyFans was launched by Timothy Stokely in 2016. His pitch was simple but effective. Why not create a platform that allows these entertainers to conveniently and securely monetize their content? OnlyFans would be like a social media platform with a feed, similar to that of Instagram and Twitter, except that fans are required to pay a monthly subscription to view the content of these entertainers. And if they are willing to pay more, they could unlock paywalls for even more valuable services. The company was extremely successful and now hosts more than 2 million content creators. It has a user base of 130 million. Even though the service is pitched as a website for content creators such as physical fitness experts, musicians, etc., it’s predominantly known for its adult entertainment category. The company had explosive growth during the pandemic with its revenue rising by 540% to reach $400MM. As per a leaked pitch deck obtained by Axios (ironically, the company never mentions p*rn in its pitch deck), it’s expected to create a whopping $2.5B in revenue by 2022. The Problem So, if the growth is great and the user base is becoming more and more engaged, why did the company decide to shoot itself in the foot? As with most issues in a company, the problem lies with money! They are facing serious challenges in both the revenue stream as well as investor capital. Investor Capital 0:00 / 0:00 Even with the explosive growth, it’s not like investors are lining up for the fundraising. It would be a walk in the park to raise funding for any other company with its growth trajectory and profitability. But there are multiple challenges in the case of OnlyFans: Some VC funds are prohibited from investing in adult content as part of their partnership agreements. Even though OnlyFans has a verification process, the risk of minors creating subscription accounts is real and will do irreversible reputation damage for both the company and its investors. Even if the investors could look past all of this as the company looks to raise new funding at unicorn valuation, OnlyFans has a reputation problem. Even if the brand could move on to a “safe for work” platform, the history associated with the brand is synonymous with adult content. Given its history, it would be extremely difficult to attract brand partners and big names into the platform. The presence of big names is a must for a platform trying to become a more mainstream media site! Payment Processing While brand imaging and raising capital might be a longer-term problem for the company, the more pressing issue is a BBC investigation into how the company handles illegal content and its ramifications. If you thought Google had monopolistic power, let me introduce you to Visa and Mastercard combinedly process more than 90% of transactions and 75% of transaction volume of all Credit card purchases in the US. In Dec 2020, after a NY Times article about how P*rnHub monetizes illegal content, both Visa and Mastercard cut off payments to the site within 6 days! [1]. This caused them to remove 70% of all content (unverified) on their website (aka The Purge) to try and get the payment platforms on board. Visa and Mastercard still won’t work with the company even after all the drastic actions taken by P*rnHub. Given that the OnlyFans platform doesn’t show any ads, they would be dead in the water if their direct payment takes a hit. In April, Mastercard had announced a change to their policy [2] that requires this: The banks that connect merchants to our network... to certify that the seller of adult content has effective controls in place to monitor, block and, where necessary, take down all illegal content. The policy will come into effect on October 15th and OnlyFans is trying to be compliant by the time the policy is enforced [3] and it seems like they are going by the logic that desperate times require desperate measures [4]!   What now? The Billion dollar question is whether OnlyFans would go the way Tumblr went (Tumblr was once valued at $1.1B and was sold later for $3M) after they banned all adult content on their website. It seems that OnlyFan’s aspirations of becoming a mainstream media company and increasing regulations by payment partners are forcing the company to abandon the adult segment. While we currently don’t have an insight into their revenue split, it’s safe to say that a majority of it would be coming from the adult segment which would make the pivot even harder to pull off successfully. I don’t know a single company that has survived after throwing their most loyal userbase and revenue generators under the bus for greener pastures! Maybe they are just concerned about their short-term survival and were forced to make this decision. But dropping the same folks who made you popular in the first place is definitely going to leave a bad aftertaste. After all, what do we know? Running a billion-dollar company is a very serious business! Until next week! Footnotes [1] This would cause all normal credit card transactions to fail and then the only way for them to charge would be to directly get paid to their bank accounts or via crypto, both of which would be extremely difficult to process and scale. [2] While there is a lot of chatter around how certain groups lobbied Mastercard to change their policy, I am not getting into that as it would inevitably take a political turn. [3] To put this into perspective, if 4 companies (Visa, Mastercard, AmEx, and Discover) cut off your payment pipeline, you would effectively have no way to charge your customer! [4] There is a lot of conversation around how this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for crypto to shine with the decentralized payment system. [5] Granted, they were already seeing reduced engagement prior to the ban, but the adult content ban was the final nail in the coffin!

And if they are willing to pay more, they could unlock paywalls for even more valuable services. The company was extremely successful and now hosts more than 2 million content creators. It has a user base of 130 million. Even though the service is pitched as a website for content creators such as physical fitness experts, musicians, etc., it’s predominantly known for its adult entertainment category. The company had explosive growth during the pandemic with its revenue rising by 540% to reach $400MM. As per a leaked pitch deck obtained by Axios (ironically, the company never mentions p*rn in its pitch deck), it’s expected to create a whopping $2.5B in revenue by 2022. The Problem So, if the growth is great and the user base is becoming more and more engaged, why did the company decide to shoot itself in the foot? As with most issues in a company, the problem lies with money! They are facing serious challenges in both the revenue stream as well as investor capital. Investor Capital 0:00 / 0:00 Even with the explosive growth, it’s not like investors are lining up for the fundraising. It would be a walk in the park to raise funding for any other company with its growth trajectory and profitability. But there are multiple challenges in the case of OnlyFans: Some VC funds are prohibited from investing in adult content as part of their partnership agreements. Even though OnlyFans has a verification process, the risk of minors creating subscription accounts is real and will do irreversible reputation damage for both the company and its investors. Even if the investors could look past all of this as the company looks to raise new funding at unicorn valuation, OnlyFans has a reputation problem. Even if the brand could move on to a “safe for work” platform, the history associated with the brand is synonymous with adult content. Given its history, it would be extremely difficult to attract brand partners and big names into the platform. The presence of big names is a must for a platform trying to become a more mainstream media site! Payment Processing While brand imaging and raising capital might be a longer-term problem for the company, the more pressing issue is a BBC investigation into how the company handles illegal content and its ramifications. If you thought Google had monopolistic power, let me introduce you to Visa and Mastercard combinedly process more than 90% of transactions and 75% of transaction volume of all Credit card purchases in the US. In Dec 2020, after a NY Times article about how P*rnHub monetizes illegal content, both Visa and Mastercard cut off payments to the site within 6 days! [1]. This caused them to remove 70% of all content (unverified) on their website (aka The Purge) to try and get the payment platforms on board. Visa and Mastercard still won’t work with the company even after all the drastic actions taken by P*rnHub. Given that the OnlyFans platform doesn’t show any ads, they would be dead in the water if their direct payment takes a hit. In April, Mastercard had announced a change to their policy [2] that requires this: The banks that connect merchants to our network... to certify that the seller of adult content has effective controls in place to monitor, block and, where necessary, take down all illegal content. The policy will come into effect on October 15th and OnlyFans is trying to be compliant by the time the policy is enforced [3] and it seems like they are going by the logic that desperate times require desperate measures [4]!   What now? The Billion dollar question is whether OnlyFans would go the way Tumblr went (Tumblr was once valued at $1.1B and was sold later for $3M) after they banned all adult content on their website. It seems that OnlyFan’s aspirations of becoming a mainstream media company and increasing regulations by payment partners are forcing the company to abandon the adult segment. While we currently don’t have an insight into their revenue split, it’s safe to say that a majority of it would be coming from the adult segment which would make the pivot even harder to pull off successfully. I don’t know a single company that has survived after throwing their most loyal userbase and revenue generators under the bus for greener pastures! Maybe they are just concerned about their short-term survival and were forced to make this decision. But dropping the same folks who made you popular in the first place is definitely going to leave a bad aftertaste. After all, what do we know? Running a billion-dollar company is a very serious business! Until next week!

It would be a walk in the park to raise funding for any other company with its growth trajectory and profitability. But there are multiple challenges in the case of OnlyFans: Some VC funds are prohibited from investing in adult content as part of their partnership agreements. Even though OnlyFans has a verification process, the risk of minors creating subscription accounts is real and will do irreversible reputation damage for both the company and its investors. Even if the investors could look past all of this as the company looks to raise new funding at unicorn valuation, OnlyFans has a reputation problem. Even if the brand could move on to a “safe for work” platform, the history associated with the brand is synonymous with adult content. Given its history, it would be extremely difficult to attract brand partners and big names into the platform. The presence of big names is a must for a platform trying to become a more mainstream media site! Payment Processing While brand imaging and raising capital might be a longer-term problem for the company, the more pressing issue is a BBC investigation into how the company handles illegal content and its ramifications. If you thought Google had monopolistic power, let me introduce you to Visa and Mastercard combinedly process more than 90% of transactions and 75% of transaction volume of all Credit card purchases in the US. In Dec 2020, after a NY Times article about how P*rnHub monetizes illegal content, both Visa and Mastercard cut off payments to the site within 6 days! [1]. This caused them to remove 70% of all content (unverified) on their website (aka The Purge) to try and get the payment platforms on board. Visa and Mastercard still won’t work with the company even after all the drastic actions taken by P*rnHub. Given that the OnlyFans platform doesn’t show any ads, they would be dead in the water if their direct payment takes a hit. In April, Mastercard had announced a change to their policy [2] that requires this: The banks that connect merchants to our network... to certify that the seller of adult content has effective controls in place to monitor, block and, where necessary, take down all illegal content. The policy will come into effect on October 15th and OnlyFans is trying to be compliant by the time the policy is enforced [3] and it seems like they are going by the logic that desperate times require desperate measures [4]!   What now? The Billion dollar question is whether OnlyFans would go the way Tumblr went (Tumblr was once valued at $1.1B and was sold later for $3M) after they banned all adult content on their website. It seems that OnlyFan’s aspirations of becoming a mainstream media company and increasing regulations by payment partners are forcing the company to abandon the adult segment. While we currently don’t have an insight into their revenue split, it’s safe to say that a majority of it would be coming from the adult segment which would make the pivot even harder to pull off successfully. I don’t know a single company that has survived after throwing their most loyal userbase and revenue generators under the bus for greener pastures! Maybe they are just concerned about their short-term survival and were forced to make this decision.

,"One of the biggest pieces of business news last week was that OnlyFans was going to bar sexually explicit videos starting from October. After the initial uproar and wave of memes, there was a lot of discussion around why a company whose main income stream is from adult content decided to kill its golden goose. Was it because they are idiots, or because of any new regulations, or is there something much larger at play here? For this week’s analysis, I would be focusing on the company’s history and my take on why they did what they did and future implications for them. So, strap in while I take one for the team with my search history and ad recommendations going into questionable territory for the considerable future. The Company OnlyFans was launched by Timothy Stokely in 2016. His pitch was simple but effective. Why not create a platform that allows these entertainers to conveniently and securely monetize their content? OnlyFans would be like a social media platform with a feed, similar to that of Instagram and Twitter, except that fans are required to pay a monthly subscription to view the content of these entertainers. And if they are willing to pay more, they could unlock paywalls for even more valuable services. The company was extremely successful and now hosts more than 2 million content creators. It has a user base of 130 million. Even though the service is pitched as a website for content creators such as physical fitness experts, musicians, etc., it’s predominantly known for its adult entertainment category. The company had explosive growth during the pandemic with its revenue rising by 540% to reach $400MM. As per a leaked pitch deck obtained by Axios (ironically, the company never mentions p*rn in its pitch deck), it’s expected to create a whopping $2.5B in revenue by 2022. The Problem So, if the growth is great and the user base is becoming more and more engaged, why did the company decide to shoot itself in the foot?

In April, Mastercard had announced a change to their policy [2] that requires this: The banks that connect merchants to our network... to certify that the seller of adult content has effective controls in place to monitor, block and, where necessary, take down all illegal content. The policy will come into effect on October 15th and OnlyFans is trying to be compliant by the time the policy is enforced [3] and it seems like they are going by the logic that desperate times require desperate measures [4]!

The Billion dollar question is whether OnlyFans would go the way Tumblr went (Tumblr was once valued at $1.1B and was sold later for $3M) after they banned all adult content on their website. It seems that OnlyFan’s aspirations of becoming a mainstream media company and increasing regulations by payment partners are forcing the company to abandon the adult segment. While we currently don’t have an insight into their revenue split, it’s safe to say that a majority of it would be coming from the adult segment which would make the pivot even harder to pull off successfully.

,"One of the biggest pieces of business news last week was that OnlyFans was going to bar sexually explicit videos starting from October. After the initial uproar and wave of memes, there was a lot of discussion around why a company whose main income stream is from adult content decided to kill its golden goose. Was it because they are idiots, or because of any new regulations, or is there something much larger at play here? For this week’s analysis, I would be focusing on the company’s history and my take on why they did what they did and future implications for them. So, strap in while I take one for the team with my search history and ad recommendations going into questionable territory for the considerable future. The Company OnlyFans was launched by Timothy Stokely in 2016. His pitch was simple but effective. Why not create a platform that allows these entertainers to conveniently and securely monetize their content? OnlyFans would be like a social media platform with a feed, similar to that of Instagram and Twitter, except that fans are required to pay a monthly subscription to view the content of these entertainers. And if they are willing to pay more, they could unlock paywalls for even more valuable services. The company was extremely successful and now hosts more than 2 million content creators. It has a user base of 130 million. Even though the service is pitched as a website for content creators such as physical fitness experts, musicians, etc., it’s predominantly known for its adult entertainment category. The company had explosive growth during the pandemic with its revenue rising by 540% to reach $400MM. As per a leaked pitch deck obtained by Axios (ironically, the company never mentions p*rn in its pitch deck), it’s expected to create a whopping $2.5B in revenue by 2022. The Problem So, if the growth is great and the user base is becoming more and more engaged, why did the company decide to shoot itself in the foot? As with most issues in a company, the problem lies with money! They are facing serious challenges in both the revenue stream as well as investor capital. Investor Capital 0:00 / 0:00 Even with the explosive growth, it’s not like investors are lining up for the fundraising. It would be a walk in the park to raise funding for any other company with its growth trajectory and profitability. But there are multiple challenges in the case of OnlyFans: Some VC funds are prohibited from investing in adult content as part of their partnership agreements. Even though OnlyFans has a verification process, the risk of minors creating subscription accounts is real and will do irreversible reputation damage for both the company and its investors. Even if the investors could look past all of this as the company looks to raise new funding at unicorn valuation, OnlyFans has a reputation problem. Even if the brand could move on to a “safe for work” platform, the history associated with the brand is synonymous with adult content.

,"One of the biggest pieces of business news last week was that OnlyFans was going to bar sexually explicit videos starting from October. After the initial uproar and wave of memes, there was a lot of discussion around why a company whose main income stream is from adult content decided to kill its golden goose. Was it because they are idiots, or because of any new regulations, or is there something much larger at play here? For this week’s analysis, I would be focusing on the company’s history and my take on why they did what they did and future implications for them. So, strap in while I take one for the team with my search history and ad recommendations going into questionable territory for the considerable future. The Company OnlyFans was launched by Timothy Stokely in 2016. His pitch was simple but effective. Why not create a platform that allows these entertainers to conveniently and securely monetize their content? OnlyFans would be like a social media platform with a feed, similar to that of Instagram and Twitter, except that fans are required to pay a monthly subscription to view the content of these entertainers. And if they are willing to pay more, they could unlock paywalls for even more valuable services. The company was extremely successful and now hosts more than 2 million content creators. It has a user base of 130 million. Even though the service is pitched as a website for content creators such as physical fitness experts, musicians, etc., it’s predominantly known for its adult entertainment category. The company had explosive growth during the pandemic with its revenue rising by 540% to reach $400MM. As per a leaked pitch deck obtained by Axios (ironically, the company never mentions p*rn in its pitch deck), it’s expected to create a whopping $2.5B in revenue by 2022. The Problem So, if the growth is great and the user base is becoming more and more engaged, why did the company decide to shoot itself in the foot? As with most issues in a company, the problem lies with money! They are facing serious challenges in both the revenue stream as well as investor capital. Investor Capital 0:00 / 0:00 Even with the explosive growth, it’s not like investors are lining up for the fundraising. It would be a walk in the park to raise funding for any other company with its growth trajectory and profitability. But there are multiple challenges in the case of OnlyFans: Some VC funds are prohibited from investing in adult content as part of their partnership agreements. Even though OnlyFans has a verification process, the risk of minors creating subscription accounts is real and will do irreversible reputation damage for both the company and its investors. Even if the investors could look past all of this as the company looks to raise new funding at unicorn valuation, OnlyFans has a reputation problem. Even if the brand could move on to a “safe for work” platform, the history associated with the brand is synonymous with adult content. Given its history, it would be extremely difficult to attract brand partners and big names into the platform. The presence of big names is a must for a platform trying to become a more mainstream media site! Payment Processing While brand imaging and raising capital might be a longer-term problem for the company, the more pressing issue is a BBC investigation into how the company handles illegal content and its ramifications. If you thought Google had monopolistic power, let me introduce you to Visa and Mastercard combinedly process more than 90% of transactions and 75% of transaction volume of all Credit card purchases in the US. In Dec 2020, after a NY Times article about how P*rnHub monetizes illegal content, both Visa and Mastercard cut off payments to the site within 6 days! [1]. This caused them to remove 70% of all content (unverified) on their website (aka The Purge) to try and get the payment platforms on board.

,"One of the biggest pieces of business news last week was that OnlyFans was going to bar sexually explicit videos starting from October. After the initial uproar and wave of memes, there was a lot of discussion around why a company whose main income stream is from adult content decided to kill its golden goose. Was it because they are idiots, or because of any new regulations, or is there something much larger at play here? For this week’s analysis, I would be focusing on the company’s history and my take on why they did what they did and future implications for them. So, strap in while I take one for the team with my search history and ad recommendations going into questionable territory for the considerable future. The Company OnlyFans was launched by Timothy Stokely in 2016. His pitch was simple but effective. Why not create a platform that allows these entertainers to conveniently and securely monetize their content? OnlyFans would be like a social media platform with a feed, similar to that of Instagram and Twitter, except that fans are required to pay a monthly subscription to view the content of these entertainers. And if they are willing to pay more, they could unlock paywalls for even more valuable services. The company was extremely successful and now hosts more than 2 million content creators. It has a user base of 130 million. Even though the service is pitched as a website for content creators such as physical fitness experts, musicians, etc., it’s predominantly known for its adult entertainment category. The company had explosive growth during the pandemic with its revenue rising by 540% to reach $400MM. As per a leaked pitch deck obtained by Axios (ironically, the company never mentions p*rn in its pitch deck), it’s expected to create a whopping $2.5B in revenue by 2022. The Problem So, if the growth is great and the user base is becoming more and more engaged, why did the company decide to shoot itself in the foot? As with most issues in a company, the problem lies with money! They are facing serious challenges in both the revenue stream as well as investor capital. Investor Capital 0:00 / 0:00 Even with the explosive growth, it’s not like investors are lining up for the fundraising. It would be a walk in the park to raise funding for any other company with its growth trajectory and profitability. But there are multiple challenges in the case of OnlyFans: Some VC funds are prohibited from investing in adult content as part of their partnership agreements. Even though OnlyFans has a verification process, the risk of minors creating subscription accounts is real and will do irreversible reputation damage for both the company and its investors. Even if the investors could look past all of this as the company looks to raise new funding at unicorn valuation, OnlyFans has a reputation problem. Even if the brand could move on to a “safe for work” platform, the history associated with the brand is synonymous with adult content. Given its history, it would be extremely difficult to attract brand partners and big names into the platform. The presence of big names is a must for a platform trying to become a more mainstream media site! Payment Processing While brand imaging and raising capital might be a longer-term problem for the company, the more pressing issue is a BBC investigation into how the company handles illegal content and its ramifications. If you thought Google had monopolistic power, let me introduce you to Visa and Mastercard combinedly process more than 90% of transactions and 75% of transaction volume of all Credit card purchases in the US. In Dec 2020, after a NY Times article about how P*rnHub monetizes illegal content, both Visa and Mastercard cut off payments to the site within 6 days! [1]. This caused them to remove 70% of all content (unverified) on their website (aka The Purge) to try and get the payment platforms on board. Visa and Mastercard still won’t work with the company even after all the drastic actions taken by P*rnHub. Given that the OnlyFans platform doesn’t show any ads, they would be dead in the water if their direct payment takes a hit. In April, Mastercard had announced a change to their policy [2] that requires this: The banks that connect merchants to our network... to certify that the seller of adult content has effective controls in place to monitor, block and, where necessary, take down all illegal content. The policy will come into effect on October 15th and OnlyFans is trying to be compliant by the time the policy is enforced [3] and it seems like they are going by the logic that desperate times require desperate measures [4]!

,"One of the biggest pieces of business news last week was that OnlyFans was going to bar sexually explicit videos starting from October. After the initial uproar and wave of memes, there was a lot of discussion around why a company whose main income stream is from adult content decided to kill its golden goose. Was it because they are idiots, or because of any new regulations, or is there something much larger at play here? For this week’s analysis, I would be focusing on the company’s history and my take on why they did what they did and future implications for them. So, strap in while I take one for the team with my search history and ad recommendations going into questionable territory for the considerable future. The Company OnlyFans was launched by Timothy Stokely in 2016. His pitch was simple but effective. Why not create a platform that allows these entertainers to conveniently and securely monetize their content? OnlyFans would be like a social media platform with a feed, similar to that of Instagram and Twitter, except that fans are required to pay a monthly subscription to view the content of these entertainers. And if they are willing to pay more, they could unlock paywalls for even more valuable services. The company was extremely successful and now hosts more than 2 million content creators. It has a user base of 130 million. Even though the service is pitched as a website for content creators such as physical fitness experts, musicians, etc., it’s predominantly known for its adult entertainment category. The company had explosive growth during the pandemic with its revenue rising by 540% to reach $400MM. As per a leaked pitch deck obtained by Axios (ironically, the company never mentions p*rn in its pitch deck), it’s expected to create a whopping $2.5B in revenue by 2022. The Problem So, if the growth is great and the user base is becoming more and more engaged, why did the company decide to shoot itself in the foot? As with most issues in a company, the problem lies with money! They are facing serious challenges in both the revenue stream as well as investor capital. Investor Capital 0:00 / 0:00 Even with the explosive growth, it’s not like investors are lining up for the fundraising. It would be a walk in the park to raise funding for any other company with its growth trajectory and profitability. But there are multiple challenges in the case of OnlyFans: Some VC funds are prohibited from investing in adult content as part of their partnership agreements. Even though OnlyFans has a verification process, the risk of minors creating subscription accounts is real and will do irreversible reputation damage for both the company and its investors. Even if the investors could look past all of this as the company looks to raise new funding at unicorn valuation, OnlyFans has a reputation problem. Even if the brand could move on to a “safe for work” platform, the history associated with the brand is synonymous with adult content. Given its history, it would be extremely difficult to attract brand partners and big names into the platform. The presence of big names is a must for a platform trying to become a more mainstream media site! Payment Processing While brand imaging and raising capital might be a longer-term problem for the company, the more pressing issue is a BBC investigation into how the company handles illegal content and its ramifications. If you thought Google had monopolistic power, let me introduce you to Visa and Mastercard combinedly process more than 90% of transactions and 75% of transaction volume of all Credit card purchases in the US. In Dec 2020, after a NY Times article about how P*rnHub monetizes illegal content, both Visa and Mastercard cut off payments to the site within 6 days! [1]. This caused them to remove 70% of all content (unverified) on their website (aka The Purge) to try and get the payment platforms on board. Visa and Mastercard still won’t work with the company even after all the drastic actions taken by P*rnHub. Given that the OnlyFans platform doesn’t show any ads, they would be dead in the water if their direct payment takes a hit. In April, Mastercard had announced a change to their policy [2] that requires this: The banks that connect merchants to our network... to certify that the seller of adult content has effective controls in place to monitor, block and, where necessary, take down all illegal content. The policy will come into effect on October 15th and OnlyFans is trying to be compliant by the time the policy is enforced [3] and it seems like they are going by the logic that desperate times require desperate measures [4]!   What now? The Billion dollar question is whether OnlyFans would go the way Tumblr went (Tumblr was once valued at $1.1B and was sold later for $3M) after they banned all adult content on their website. It seems that OnlyFan’s aspirations of becoming a mainstream media company and increasing regulations by payment partners are forcing the company to abandon the adult segment. While we currently don’t have an insight into their revenue split, it’s safe to say that a majority of it would be coming from the adult segment which would make the pivot even harder to pull off successfully.

Can use a range of options to fund purchases from fiat like bank transfers, credit/debit cards, 3rd party payment processor's, cash (if doing P2P in person).So on ramping to crypto is becoming a lot easier and mainstream.Where the problem lays still though is Joe Public's understanding of the use, storage and security of said crypto! It can be very overwhelming in the beginning because what crypto does (in a nutshell) is take away all the middlemen/services that usually provide such services as ensuring the right person gets paid when you send money, reversal of incorrect transaction, security, loss prevention and loss recovery and so on. These are ALL services that we have come to expect in our day to day use of the current financial system.With crypto, there is NONE of that! You become responsible for everything YOU do in crypto! You send to the wrong wallet address.... that transaction is final! You give out your wallet seed phrase to phishers/hackers/scammers, that's on you and everything is gone.Personally, I think its FANTASTIC that the individual re-takes 100% responsibility and control over their own affairs.... but for many older people this is and will remain a stumbling block to mainstream uptake. I'm in my 40's and use crypto all the time plus invest in it, its not like its hard to get your head around it all, its just understanding that the individual becomes 100% responsible!I think the generations coming into the workforce today and younger though WILL take to crypto mainstream use like ducks to water. That's when we will start seeing a real shift in the way value is transacted in the world and crypto will become a mainstream medium of transaction.",2,0.527,POSITIVE,0.913

Probably at least fifty thousand or more.This is a policy decision by only-fans that is just waiting for someone to move into the niche vacuum they will have accidentally created come October. The beautiful thing about the internet is that it has evolved to move incredibly quickly. Think you can stand up an only-fans clone in less than a month and a half? The world is your oyster if you can. You will have 50k content creators and all their customers in your pocket upon exiting MVP beta.Here's a little eye-opener for the boards of both Only-Fans and Patreon: what makes you think a SPAC would only want one of you? Essentially, they're going to want to become MTCH (a holding company for all the dating apps). You're only worth about half as much as you think you are. If a viable contender soaks up all the porn content, you're only worth a third of the number rattling around in that empty head of yours. It would have been far better to spin off that genera of content into a separate container company so that you could offer it as a ""above and beyond"".",0,0.523,NEGATIVE,0.999
,"One of the biggest pieces of business news last week was that OnlyFans was going to bar sexually explicit videos starting from October. After the initial uproar and wave of memes, there was a lot of discussion around why a company whose main income stream is from adult content decided to kill its golden goose. Was it because they are idiots, or because of any new regulations, or is there something much larger at play here? For this week’s analysis, I would be focusing on the company’s history and my take on why they did what they did and future implications for them. So, strap in while I take one for the team with my search history and ad recommendations going into questionable territory for the considerable future. The Company OnlyFans was launched by Timothy Stokely in 2016. His pitch was simple but effective. Why not create a platform that allows these entertainers to conveniently and securely monetize their content? OnlyFans would be like a social media platform with a feed, similar to that of Instagram and Twitter, except that fans are required to pay a monthly subscription to view the content of these entertainers. And if they are willing to pay more, they could unlock paywalls for even more valuable services. The company was extremely successful and now hosts more than 2 million content creators. It has a user base of 130 million. Even though the service is pitched as a website for content creators such as physical fitness experts, musicians, etc., it’s predominantly known for its adult entertainment category. The company had explosive growth during the pandemic with its revenue rising by 540% to reach $400MM. As per a leaked pitch deck obtained by Axios (ironically, the company never mentions p*rn in its pitch deck), it’s expected to create a whopping $2.5B in revenue by 2022. The Problem So, if the growth is great and the user base is becoming more and more engaged, why did the company decide to shoot itself in the foot? As with most issues in a company, the problem lies with money! They are facing serious challenges in both the revenue stream as well as investor capital. Investor Capital 0:00 / 0:00 Even with the explosive growth, it’s not like investors are lining up for the fundraising. It would be a walk in the park to raise funding for any other company with its growth trajectory and profitability. But there are multiple challenges in the case of OnlyFans: Some VC funds are prohibited from investing in adult content as part of their partnership agreements. Even though OnlyFans has a verification process, the risk of minors creating subscription accounts is real and will do irreversible reputation damage for both the company and its investors. Even if the investors could look past all of this as the company looks to raise new funding at unicorn valuation, OnlyFans has a reputation problem. Even if the brand could move on to a “safe for work” platform, the history associated with the brand is synonymous with adult content. Given its history, it would be extremely difficult to attract brand partners and big names into the platform. The presence of big names is a must for a platform trying to become a more mainstream media site! Payment Processing While brand imaging and raising capital might be a longer-term problem for the company, the more pressing issue is a BBC investigation into how the company handles illegal content and its ramifications. If you thought Google had monopolistic power, let me introduce you to Visa and Mastercard combinedly process more than 90% of transactions and 75% of transaction volume of all Credit card purchases in the US. In Dec 2020, after a NY Times article about how P*rnHub monetizes illegal content, both Visa and Mastercard cut off payments to the site within 6 days! [1]. This caused them to remove 70% of all content (unverified) on their website (aka The Purge) to try and get the payment platforms on board. Visa and Mastercard still won’t work with the company even after all the drastic actions taken by P*rnHub.

The presence of big names is a must for a platform trying to become a more mainstream media site! Payment Processing While brand imaging and raising capital might be a longer-term problem for the company, the more pressing issue is a BBC investigation into how the company handles illegal content and its ramifications. If you thought Google had monopolistic power, let me introduce you to Visa and Mastercard combinedly process more than 90% of transactions and 75% of transaction volume of all Credit card purchases in the US. In Dec 2020, after a NY Times article about how P*rnHub monetizes illegal content, both Visa and Mastercard cut off payments to the site within 6 days! [1]. This caused them to remove 70% of all content (unverified) on their website (aka The Purge) to try and get the payment platforms on board. Visa and Mastercard still won’t work with the company even after all the drastic actions taken by P*rnHub. Given that the OnlyFans platform doesn’t show any ads, they would be dead in the water if their direct payment takes a hit. In April, Mastercard had announced a change to their policy [2] that requires this: The banks that connect merchants to our network... to certify that the seller of adult content has effective controls in place to monitor, block and, where necessary, take down all illegal content. The policy will come into effect on October 15th and OnlyFans is trying to be compliant by the time the policy is enforced [3] and it seems like they are going by the logic that desperate times require desperate measures [4]!   What now? The Billion dollar question is whether OnlyFans would go the way Tumblr went (Tumblr was once valued at $1.1B and was sold later for $3M) after they banned all adult content on their website. It seems that OnlyFan’s aspirations of becoming a mainstream media company and increasing regulations by payment partners are forcing the company to abandon the adult segment. While we currently don’t have an insight into their revenue split, it’s safe to say that a majority of it would be coming from the adult segment which would make the pivot even harder to pull off successfully. I don’t know a single company that has survived after throwing their most loyal userbase and revenue generators under the bus for greener pastures! Maybe they are just concerned about their short-term survival and were forced to make this decision. But dropping the same folks who made you popular in the first place is definitely going to leave a bad aftertaste. After all, what do we know?

,"One of the biggest pieces of business news last week was that OnlyFans was going to bar sexually explicit videos starting from October. After the initial uproar and wave of memes, there was a lot of discussion around why a company whose main income stream is from adult content decided to kill its golden goose. Was it because they are idiots, or because of any new regulations, or is there something much larger at play here? For this week’s analysis, I would be focusing on the company’s history and my take on why they did what they did and future implications for them. So, strap in while I take one for the team with my search history and ad recommendations going into questionable territory for the considerable future. The Company OnlyFans was launched by Timothy Stokely in 2016. His pitch was simple but effective. Why not create a platform that allows these entertainers to conveniently and securely monetize their content? OnlyFans would be like a social media platform with a feed, similar to that of Instagram and Twitter, except that fans are required to pay a monthly subscription to view the content of these entertainers. And if they are willing to pay more, they could unlock paywalls for even more valuable services. The company was extremely successful and now hosts more than 2 million content creators. It has a user base of 130 million. Even though the service is pitched as a website for content creators such as physical fitness experts, musicians, etc., it’s predominantly known for its adult entertainment category. The company had explosive growth during the pandemic with its revenue rising by 540% to reach $400MM. As per a leaked pitch deck obtained by Axios (ironically, the company never mentions p*rn in its pitch deck), it’s expected to create a whopping $2.5B in revenue by 2022. The Problem So, if the growth is great and the user base is becoming more and more engaged, why did the company decide to shoot itself in the foot? As with most issues in a company, the problem lies with money! They are facing serious challenges in both the revenue stream as well as investor capital. Investor Capital 0:00 / 0:00 Even with the explosive growth, it’s not like investors are lining up for the fundraising. It would be a walk in the park to raise funding for any other company with its growth trajectory and profitability. But there are multiple challenges in the case of OnlyFans: Some VC funds are prohibited from investing in adult content as part of their partnership agreements. Even though OnlyFans has a verification process, the risk of minors creating subscription accounts is real and will do irreversible reputation damage for both the company and its investors. Even if the investors could look past all of this as the company looks to raise new funding at unicorn valuation, OnlyFans has a reputation problem.

This caused them to remove 70% of all content (unverified) on their website (aka The Purge) to try and get the payment platforms on board. Visa and Mastercard still won’t work with the company even after all the drastic actions taken by P*rnHub. Given that the OnlyFans platform doesn’t show any ads, they would be dead in the water if their direct payment takes a hit. In April, Mastercard had announced a change to their policy [2] that requires this: The banks that connect merchants to our network... to certify that the seller of adult content has effective controls in place to monitor, block and, where necessary, take down all illegal content. The policy will come into effect on October 15th and OnlyFans is trying to be compliant by the time the policy is enforced [3] and it seems like they are going by the logic that desperate times require desperate measures [4]!   What now? The Billion dollar question is whether OnlyFans would go the way Tumblr went (Tumblr was once valued at $1.1B and was sold later for $3M) after they banned all adult content on their website. It seems that OnlyFan’s aspirations of becoming a mainstream media company and increasing regulations by payment partners are forcing the company to abandon the adult segment. While we currently don’t have an insight into their revenue split, it’s safe to say that a majority of it would be coming from the adult segment which would make the pivot even harder to pull off successfully. I don’t know a single company that has survived after throwing their most loyal userbase and revenue generators under the bus for greener pastures! Maybe they are just concerned about their short-term survival and were forced to make this decision. But dropping the same folks who made you popular in the first place is definitely going to leave a bad aftertaste. After all, what do we know? Running a billion-dollar company is a very serious business! Until next week!

,"One of the biggest pieces of business news last week was that OnlyFans was going to bar sexually explicit videos starting from October. After the initial uproar and wave of memes, there was a lot of discussion around why a company whose main income stream is from adult content decided to kill its golden goose. Was it because they are idiots, or because of any new regulations, or is there something much larger at play here? For this week’s analysis, I would be focusing on the company’s history and my take on why they did what they did and future implications for them. So, strap in while I take one for the team with my search history and ad recommendations going into questionable territory for the considerable future. The Company OnlyFans was launched by Timothy Stokely in 2016. His pitch was simple but effective. Why not create a platform that allows these entertainers to conveniently and securely monetize their content? OnlyFans would be like a social media platform with a feed, similar to that of Instagram and Twitter, except that fans are required to pay a monthly subscription to view the content of these entertainers. And if they are willing to pay more, they could unlock paywalls for even more valuable services. The company was extremely successful and now hosts more than 2 million content creators. It has a user base of 130 million. Even though the service is pitched as a website for content creators such as physical fitness experts, musicians, etc., it’s predominantly known for its adult entertainment category. The company had explosive growth during the pandemic with its revenue rising by 540% to reach $400MM. As per a leaked pitch deck obtained by Axios (ironically, the company never mentions p*rn in its pitch deck), it’s expected to create a whopping $2.5B in revenue by 2022. The Problem So, if the growth is great and the user base is becoming more and more engaged, why did the company decide to shoot itself in the foot? As with most issues in a company, the problem lies with money! They are facing serious challenges in both the revenue stream as well as investor capital. Investor Capital 0:00 / 0:00 Even with the explosive growth, it’s not like investors are lining up for the fundraising. It would be a walk in the park to raise funding for any other company with its growth trajectory and profitability. But there are multiple challenges in the case of OnlyFans: Some VC funds are prohibited from investing in adult content as part of their partnership agreements. Even though OnlyFans has a verification process, the risk of minors creating subscription accounts is real and will do irreversible reputation damage for both the company and its investors. Even if the investors could look past all of this as the company looks to raise new funding at unicorn valuation, OnlyFans has a reputation problem. Even if the brand could move on to a “safe for work” platform, the history associated with the brand is synonymous with adult content. Given its history, it would be extremely difficult to attract brand partners and big names into the platform. The presence of big names is a must for a platform trying to become a more mainstream media site!

It seems to me like a no brainer that crypto is the solution to this adult content problem long-term. One could fund their wallets from any exchange out there and transfer to as many wallets as necessary to get around current or future restrictions before ultimately getting into their adult content platform.,1,0.52,POSITIVE,0.802
,"One of the biggest pieces of business news last week was that OnlyFans was going to bar sexually explicit videos starting from October. After the initial uproar and wave of memes, there was a lot of discussion around why a company whose main income stream is from adult content decided to kill its golden goose. Was it because they are idiots, or because of any new regulations, or is there something much larger at play here? For this week’s analysis, I would be focusing on the company’s history and my take on why they did what they did and future implications for them. So, strap in while I take one for the team with my search history and ad recommendations going into questionable territory for the considerable future. The Company OnlyFans was launched by Timothy Stokely in 2016. His pitch was simple but effective. Why not create a platform that allows these entertainers to conveniently and securely monetize their content? OnlyFans would be like a social media platform with a feed, similar to that of Instagram and Twitter, except that fans are required to pay a monthly subscription to view the content of these entertainers. And if they are willing to pay more, they could unlock paywalls for even more valuable services. The company was extremely successful and now hosts more than 2 million content creators. It has a user base of 130 million. Even though the service is pitched as a website for content creators such as physical fitness experts, musicians, etc., it’s predominantly known for its adult entertainment category. The company had explosive growth during the pandemic with its revenue rising by 540% to reach $400MM. As per a leaked pitch deck obtained by Axios (ironically, the company never mentions p*rn in its pitch deck), it’s expected to create a whopping $2.5B in revenue by 2022. The Problem So, if the growth is great and the user base is becoming more and more engaged, why did the company decide to shoot itself in the foot? As with most issues in a company, the problem lies with money! They are facing serious challenges in both the revenue stream as well as investor capital. Investor Capital 0:00 / 0:00 Even with the explosive growth, it’s not like investors are lining up for the fundraising. It would be a walk in the park to raise funding for any other company with its growth trajectory and profitability. But there are multiple challenges in the case of OnlyFans: Some VC funds are prohibited from investing in adult content as part of their partnership agreements. Even though OnlyFans has a verification process, the risk of minors creating subscription accounts is real and will do irreversible reputation damage for both the company and its investors. Even if the investors could look past all of this as the company looks to raise new funding at unicorn valuation, OnlyFans has a reputation problem. Even if the brand could move on to a “safe for work” platform, the history associated with the brand is synonymous with adult content. Given its history, it would be extremely difficult to attract brand partners and big names into the platform. The presence of big names is a must for a platform trying to become a more mainstream media site! Payment Processing While brand imaging and raising capital might be a longer-term problem for the company, the more pressing issue is a BBC investigation into how the company handles illegal content and its ramifications. If you thought Google had monopolistic power, let me introduce you to Visa and Mastercard combinedly process more than 90% of transactions and 75% of transaction volume of all Credit card purchases in the US. In Dec 2020, after a NY Times article about how P*rnHub monetizes illegal content, both Visa and Mastercard cut off payments to the site within 6 days! [1].

,"One of the biggest pieces of business news last week was that OnlyFans was going to bar sexually explicit videos starting from October. After the initial uproar and wave of memes, there was a lot of discussion around why a company whose main income stream is from adult content decided to kill its golden goose. Was it because they are idiots, or because of any new regulations, or is there something much larger at play here? For this week’s analysis, I would be focusing on the company’s history and my take on why they did what they did and future implications for them. So, strap in while I take one for the team with my search history and ad recommendations going into questionable territory for the considerable future. The Company OnlyFans was launched by Timothy Stokely in 2016. His pitch was simple but effective. Why not create a platform that allows these entertainers to conveniently and securely monetize their content? OnlyFans would be like a social media platform with a feed, similar to that of Instagram and Twitter, except that fans are required to pay a monthly subscription to view the content of these entertainers. And if they are willing to pay more, they could unlock paywalls for even more valuable services. The company was extremely successful and now hosts more than 2 million content creators. It has a user base of 130 million. Even though the service is pitched as a website for content creators such as physical fitness experts, musicians, etc., it’s predominantly known for its adult entertainment category. The company had explosive growth during the pandemic with its revenue rising by 540% to reach $400MM. As per a leaked pitch deck obtained by Axios (ironically, the company never mentions p*rn in its pitch deck), it’s expected to create a whopping $2.5B in revenue by 2022. The Problem So, if the growth is great and the user base is becoming more and more engaged, why did the company decide to shoot itself in the foot? As with most issues in a company, the problem lies with money! They are facing serious challenges in both the revenue stream as well as investor capital. Investor Capital 0:00 / 0:00 Even with the explosive growth, it’s not like investors are lining up for the fundraising. It would be a walk in the park to raise funding for any other company with its growth trajectory and profitability. But there are multiple challenges in the case of OnlyFans: Some VC funds are prohibited from investing in adult content as part of their partnership agreements. Even though OnlyFans has a verification process, the risk of minors creating subscription accounts is real and will do irreversible reputation damage for both the company and its investors. Even if the investors could look past all of this as the company looks to raise new funding at unicorn valuation, OnlyFans has a reputation problem. Even if the brand could move on to a “safe for work” platform, the history associated with the brand is synonymous with adult content. Given its history, it would be extremely difficult to attract brand partners and big names into the platform. The presence of big names is a must for a platform trying to become a more mainstream media site! Payment Processing While brand imaging and raising capital might be a longer-term problem for the company, the more pressing issue is a BBC investigation into how the company handles illegal content and its ramifications. If you thought Google had monopolistic power, let me introduce you to Visa and Mastercard combinedly process more than 90% of transactions and 75% of transaction volume of all Credit card purchases in the US. In Dec 2020, after a NY Times article about how P*rnHub monetizes illegal content, both Visa and Mastercard cut off payments to the site within 6 days! [1]. This caused them to remove 70% of all content (unverified) on their website (aka The Purge) to try and get the payment platforms on board. Visa and Mastercard still won’t work with the company even after all the drastic actions taken by P*rnHub. Given that the OnlyFans platform doesn’t show any ads, they would be dead in the water if their direct payment takes a hit. In April, Mastercard had announced a change to their policy [2] that requires this: The banks that connect merchants to our network... to certify that the seller of adult content has effective controls in place to monitor, block and, where necessary, take down all illegal content. The policy will come into effect on October 15th and OnlyFans is trying to be compliant by the time the policy is enforced [3] and it seems like they are going by the logic that desperate times require desperate measures [4]!   What now? The Billion dollar question is whether OnlyFans would go the way Tumblr went (Tumblr was once valued at $1.1B and was sold later for $3M) after they banned all adult content on their website.

,"One of the biggest pieces of business news last week was that OnlyFans was going to bar sexually explicit videos starting from October. After the initial uproar and wave of memes, there was a lot of discussion around why a company whose main income stream is from adult content decided to kill its golden goose. Was it because they are idiots, or because of any new regulations, or is there something much larger at play here? For this week’s analysis, I would be focusing on the company’s history and my take on why they did what they did and future implications for them. So, strap in while I take one for the team with my search history and ad recommendations going into questionable territory for the considerable future. The Company OnlyFans was launched by Timothy Stokely in 2016. His pitch was simple but effective. Why not create a platform that allows these entertainers to conveniently and securely monetize their content? OnlyFans would be like a social media platform with a feed, similar to that of Instagram and Twitter, except that fans are required to pay a monthly subscription to view the content of these entertainers. And if they are willing to pay more, they could unlock paywalls for even more valuable services. The company was extremely successful and now hosts more than 2 million content creators. It has a user base of 130 million. Even though the service is pitched as a website for content creators such as physical fitness experts, musicians, etc., it’s predominantly known for its adult entertainment category. The company had explosive growth during the pandemic with its revenue rising by 540% to reach $400MM. As per a leaked pitch deck obtained by Axios (ironically, the company never mentions p*rn in its pitch deck), it’s expected to create a whopping $2.5B in revenue by 2022. The Problem So, if the growth is great and the user base is becoming more and more engaged, why did the company decide to shoot itself in the foot? As with most issues in a company, the problem lies with money! They are facing serious challenges in both the revenue stream as well as investor capital. Investor Capital 0:00 / 0:00 Even with the explosive growth, it’s not like investors are lining up for the fundraising. It would be a walk in the park to raise funding for any other company with its growth trajectory and profitability. But there are multiple challenges in the case of OnlyFans: Some VC funds are prohibited from investing in adult content as part of their partnership agreements. Even though OnlyFans has a verification process, the risk of minors creating subscription accounts is real and will do irreversible reputation damage for both the company and its investors. Even if the investors could look past all of this as the company looks to raise new funding at unicorn valuation, OnlyFans has a reputation problem. Even if the brand could move on to a “safe for work” platform, the history associated with the brand is synonymous with adult content. Given its history, it would be extremely difficult to attract brand partners and big names into the platform. The presence of big names is a must for a platform trying to become a more mainstream media site! Payment Processing While brand imaging and raising capital might be a longer-term problem for the company, the more pressing issue is a BBC investigation into how the company handles illegal content and its ramifications. If you thought Google had monopolistic power, let me introduce you to Visa and Mastercard combinedly process more than 90% of transactions and 75% of transaction volume of all Credit card purchases in the US. In Dec 2020, after a NY Times article about how P*rnHub monetizes illegal content, both Visa and Mastercard cut off payments to the site within 6 days! [1]. This caused them to remove 70% of all content (unverified) on their website (aka The Purge) to try and get the payment platforms on board. Visa and Mastercard still won’t work with the company even after all the drastic actions taken by P*rnHub. Given that the OnlyFans platform doesn’t show any ads, they would be dead in the water if their direct payment takes a hit. In April, Mastercard had announced a change to their policy [2] that requires this: The banks that connect merchants to our network... to certify that the seller of adult content has effective controls in place to monitor, block and, where necessary, take down all illegal content. The policy will come into effect on October 15th and OnlyFans is trying to be compliant by the time the policy is enforced [3] and it seems like they are going by the logic that desperate times require desperate measures [4]!   What now? The Billion dollar question is whether OnlyFans would go the way Tumblr went (Tumblr was once valued at $1.1B and was sold later for $3M) after they banned all adult content on their website. It seems that OnlyFan’s aspirations of becoming a mainstream media company and increasing regulations by payment partners are forcing the company to abandon the adult segment. While we currently don’t have an insight into their revenue split, it’s safe to say that a majority of it would be coming from the adult segment which would make the pivot even harder to pull off successfully. I don’t know a single company that has survived after throwing their most loyal userbase and revenue generators under the bus for greener pastures! Maybe they are just concerned about their short-term survival and were forced to make this decision.

,"One of the biggest pieces of business news last week was that OnlyFans was going to bar sexually explicit videos starting from October. After the initial uproar and wave of memes, there was a lot of discussion around why a company whose main income stream is from adult content decided to kill its golden goose. Was it because they are idiots, or because of any new regulations, or is there something much larger at play here? For this week’s analysis, I would be focusing on the company’s history and my take on why they did what they did and future implications for them. So, strap in while I take one for the team with my search history and ad recommendations going into questionable territory for the considerable future. The Company OnlyFans was launched by Timothy Stokely in 2016. His pitch was simple but effective. Why not create a platform that allows these entertainers to conveniently and securely monetize their content? OnlyFans would be like a social media platform with a feed, similar to that of Instagram and Twitter, except that fans are required to pay a monthly subscription to view the content of these entertainers. And if they are willing to pay more, they could unlock paywalls for even more valuable services. The company was extremely successful and now hosts more than 2 million content creators. It has a user base of 130 million. Even though the service is pitched as a website for content creators such as physical fitness experts, musicians, etc., it’s predominantly known for its adult entertainment category. The company had explosive growth during the pandemic with its revenue rising by 540% to reach $400MM. As per a leaked pitch deck obtained by Axios (ironically, the company never mentions p*rn in its pitch deck), it’s expected to create a whopping $2.5B in revenue by 2022. The Problem So, if the growth is great and the user base is becoming more and more engaged, why did the company decide to shoot itself in the foot? As with most issues in a company, the problem lies with money! They are facing serious challenges in both the revenue stream as well as investor capital. Investor Capital 0:00 / 0:00 Even with the explosive growth, it’s not like investors are lining up for the fundraising. It would be a walk in the park to raise funding for any other company with its growth trajectory and profitability. But there are multiple challenges in the case of OnlyFans: Some VC funds are prohibited from investing in adult content as part of their partnership agreements. Even though OnlyFans has a verification process, the risk of minors creating subscription accounts is real and will do irreversible reputation damage for both the company and its investors. Even if the investors could look past all of this as the company looks to raise new funding at unicorn valuation, OnlyFans has a reputation problem. Even if the brand could move on to a “safe for work” platform, the history associated with the brand is synonymous with adult content. Given its history, it would be extremely difficult to attract brand partners and big names into the platform. The presence of big names is a must for a platform trying to become a more mainstream media site! Payment Processing While brand imaging and raising capital might be a longer-term problem for the company, the more pressing issue is a BBC investigation into how the company handles illegal content and its ramifications. If you thought Google had monopolistic power, let me introduce you to Visa and Mastercard combinedly process more than 90% of transactions and 75% of transaction volume of all Credit card purchases in the US. In Dec 2020, after a NY Times article about how P*rnHub monetizes illegal content, both Visa and Mastercard cut off payments to the site within 6 days! [1]. This caused them to remove 70% of all content (unverified) on their website (aka The Purge) to try and get the payment platforms on board. Visa and Mastercard still won’t work with the company even after all the drastic actions taken by P*rnHub. Given that the OnlyFans platform doesn’t show any ads, they would be dead in the water if their direct payment takes a hit. In April, Mastercard had announced a change to their policy [2] that requires this: The banks that connect merchants to our network... to certify that the seller of adult content has effective controls in place to monitor, block and, where necessary, take down all illegal content. The policy will come into effect on October 15th and OnlyFans is trying to be compliant by the time the policy is enforced [3] and it seems like they are going by the logic that desperate times require desperate measures [4]!   What now? The Billion dollar question is whether OnlyFans would go the way Tumblr went (Tumblr was once valued at $1.1B and was sold later for $3M) after they banned all adult content on their website. It seems that OnlyFan’s aspirations of becoming a mainstream media company and increasing regulations by payment partners are forcing the company to abandon the adult segment. While we currently don’t have an insight into their revenue split, it’s safe to say that a majority of it would be coming from the adult segment which would make the pivot even harder to pull off successfully. I don’t know a single company that has survived after throwing their most loyal userbase and revenue generators under the bus for greener pastures! Maybe they are just concerned about their short-term survival and were forced to make this decision.

Why not create a platform that allows these entertainers to conveniently and securely monetize their content? OnlyFans would be like a social media platform with a feed, similar to that of Instagram and Twitter, except that fans are required to pay a monthly subscription to view the content of these entertainers. And if they are willing to pay more, they could unlock paywalls for even more valuable services. The company was extremely successful and now hosts more than 2 million content creators. It has a user base of 130 million. Even though the service is pitched as a website for content creators such as physical fitness experts, musicians, etc., it’s predominantly known for its adult entertainment category. The company had explosive growth during the pandemic with its revenue rising by 540% to reach $400MM. As per a leaked pitch deck obtained by Axios (ironically, the company never mentions p*rn in its pitch deck), it’s expected to create a whopping $2.5B in revenue by 2022. The Problem So, if the growth is great and the user base is becoming more and more engaged, why did the company decide to shoot itself in the foot? As with most issues in a company, the problem lies with money! They are facing serious challenges in both the revenue stream as well as investor capital. Investor Capital 0:00 / 0:00 Even with the explosive growth, it’s not like investors are lining up for the fundraising. It would be a walk in the park to raise funding for any other company with its growth trajectory and profitability. But there are multiple challenges in the case of OnlyFans: Some VC funds are prohibited from investing in adult content as part of their partnership agreements. Even though OnlyFans has a verification process, the risk of minors creating subscription accounts is real and will do irreversible reputation damage for both the company and its investors. Even if the investors could look past all of this as the company looks to raise new funding at unicorn valuation, OnlyFans has a reputation problem. Even if the brand could move on to a “safe for work” platform, the history associated with the brand is synonymous with adult content. Given its history, it would be extremely difficult to attract brand partners and big names into the platform. The presence of big names is a must for a platform trying to become a more mainstream media site! Payment Processing While brand imaging and raising capital might be a longer-term problem for the company, the more pressing issue is a BBC investigation into how the company handles illegal content and its ramifications. If you thought Google had monopolistic power, let me introduce you to Visa and Mastercard combinedly process more than 90% of transactions and 75% of transaction volume of all Credit card purchases in the US. In Dec 2020, after a NY Times article about how P*rnHub monetizes illegal content, both Visa and Mastercard cut off payments to the site within 6 days! [1]. This caused them to remove 70% of all content (unverified) on their website (aka The Purge) to try and get the payment platforms on board. Visa and Mastercard still won’t work with the company even after all the drastic actions taken by P*rnHub. Given that the OnlyFans platform doesn’t show any ads, they would be dead in the water if their direct payment takes a hit. In April, Mastercard had announced a change to their policy [2] that requires this: The banks that connect merchants to our network... to certify that the seller of adult content has effective controls in place to monitor, block and, where necessary, take down all illegal content. The policy will come into effect on October 15th and OnlyFans is trying to be compliant by the time the policy is enforced [3] and it seems like they are going by the logic that desperate times require desperate measures [4]!   What now? The Billion dollar question is whether OnlyFans would go the way Tumblr went (Tumblr was once valued at $1.1B and was sold later for $3M) after they banned all adult content on their website. It seems that OnlyFan’s aspirations of becoming a mainstream media company and increasing regulations by payment partners are forcing the company to abandon the adult segment. While we currently don’t have an insight into their revenue split, it’s safe to say that a majority of it would be coming from the adult segment which would make the pivot even harder to pull off successfully. I don’t know a single company that has survived after throwing their most loyal userbase and revenue generators under the bus for greener pastures! Maybe they are just concerned about their short-term survival and were forced to make this decision. But dropping the same folks who made you popular in the first place is definitely going to leave a bad aftertaste. After all, what do we know? Running a billion-dollar company is a very serious business! Until next week! Footnotes [1] This would cause all normal credit card transactions to fail and then the only way for them to charge would be to directly get paid to their bank accounts or via crypto, both of which would be extremely difficult to process and scale. [2] While there is a lot of chatter around how certain groups lobbied Mastercard to change their policy, I am not getting into that as it would inevitably take a political turn. [3] To put this into perspective, if 4 companies (Visa, Mastercard, AmEx, and Discover) cut off your payment pipeline, you would effectively have no way to charge your customer! [4] There is a lot of conversation around how this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for crypto to shine with the decentralized payment system. [5] Granted, they were already seeing reduced engagement prior to the ban, but the adult content ban was the final nail in the coffin! This is a hilarious parody video of Tumblr CEO explaining the ban! [6]Apologies for filtering out all the adult words as I didn’t want to get tagged in spam filters. As always, please note that I am not a financial advisor. Hope you enjoyed this week’s analysis.","The only thing missed there is the how and why of the PornHub thing in the first place.The “Trafficking Hub” movement was created in response to some very problematic content on PornHub and they had very little success when they went up against PH directly, hence they attacked via V and MC, and had great success.Now “Trafficking Hub” have some great goals, and a LOT of support from both sides of the aisle. However what isn’t known to most is Trafficking Hub had a huge amount of support, financial, Astro turf and leadership wise from a group called Exodus Cry.Exodus Cry is a very religious and VERY puritanical group whose publicly stated goals is to end all sex workers everywhere. For everything. Including things like strip clubs and most definitely any form sexualised or explicit content.Exodus Cry position themselves as being pro sex worker rights to the left, and anti sex trafficking to the right, and so are themselves being funded heavily from the left and right.Exodus Cry, with their win from PH, are of course going up against OF next. And everyone else after that.TL;DR: While this was on the surface pressure from Visa and MasterCard, it was in fact from a heavily puritanical group determined to stop the entire sex industry, under the guise of protecting people.",0,0.516,NEGATIVE,0.939

Why not create a platform that allows these entertainers to conveniently and securely monetize their content? OnlyFans would be like a social media platform with a feed, similar to that of Instagram and Twitter, except that fans are required to pay a monthly subscription to view the content of these entertainers. And if they are willing to pay more, they could unlock paywalls for even more valuable services. The company was extremely successful and now hosts more than 2 million content creators. It has a user base of 130 million. Even though the service is pitched as a website for content creators such as physical fitness experts, musicians, etc., it’s predominantly known for its adult entertainment category. The company had explosive growth during the pandemic with its revenue rising by 540% to reach $400MM. As per a leaked pitch deck obtained by Axios (ironically, the company never mentions p*rn in its pitch deck), it’s expected to create a whopping $2.5B in revenue by 2022. The Problem So, if the growth is great and the user base is becoming more and more engaged, why did the company decide to shoot itself in the foot? As with most issues in a company, the problem lies with money! They are facing serious challenges in both the revenue stream as well as investor capital. Investor Capital 0:00 / 0:00 Even with the explosive growth, it’s not like investors are lining up for the fundraising. It would be a walk in the park to raise funding for any other company with its growth trajectory and profitability. But there are multiple challenges in the case of OnlyFans: Some VC funds are prohibited from investing in adult content as part of their partnership agreements. Even though OnlyFans has a verification process, the risk of minors creating subscription accounts is real and will do irreversible reputation damage for both the company and its investors. Even if the investors could look past all of this as the company looks to raise new funding at unicorn valuation, OnlyFans has a reputation problem. Even if the brand could move on to a “safe for work” platform, the history associated with the brand is synonymous with adult content. Given its history, it would be extremely difficult to attract brand partners and big names into the platform. The presence of big names is a must for a platform trying to become a more mainstream media site! Payment Processing While brand imaging and raising capital might be a longer-term problem for the company, the more pressing issue is a BBC investigation into how the company handles illegal content and its ramifications. If you thought Google had monopolistic power, let me introduce you to Visa and Mastercard combinedly process more than 90% of transactions and 75% of transaction volume of all Credit card purchases in the US. In Dec 2020, after a NY Times article about how P*rnHub monetizes illegal content, both Visa and Mastercard cut off payments to the site within 6 days! [1]. This caused them to remove 70% of all content (unverified) on their website (aka The Purge) to try and get the payment platforms on board. Visa and Mastercard still won’t work with the company even after all the drastic actions taken by P*rnHub. Given that the OnlyFans platform doesn’t show any ads, they would be dead in the water if their direct payment takes a hit. In April, Mastercard had announced a change to their policy [2] that requires this: The banks that connect merchants to our network... to certify that the seller of adult content has effective controls in place to monitor, block and, where necessary, take down all illegal content. The policy will come into effect on October 15th and OnlyFans is trying to be compliant by the time the policy is enforced [3] and it seems like they are going by the logic that desperate times require desperate measures [4]!   What now? The Billion dollar question is whether OnlyFans would go the way Tumblr went (Tumblr was once valued at $1.1B and was sold later for $3M) after they banned all adult content on their website. It seems that OnlyFan’s aspirations of becoming a mainstream media company and increasing regulations by payment partners are forcing the company to abandon the adult segment. While we currently don’t have an insight into their revenue split, it’s safe to say that a majority of it would be coming from the adult segment which would make the pivot even harder to pull off successfully. I don’t know a single company that has survived after throwing their most loyal userbase and revenue generators under the bus for greener pastures! Maybe they are just concerned about their short-term survival and were forced to make this decision. But dropping the same folks who made you popular in the first place is definitely going to leave a bad aftertaste. After all, what do we know? Running a billion-dollar company is a very serious business! Until next week! Footnotes [1] This would cause all normal credit card transactions to fail and then the only way for them to charge would be to directly get paid to their bank accounts or via crypto, both of which would be extremely difficult to process and scale.

The Problem So, if the growth is great and the user base is becoming more and more engaged, why did the company decide to shoot itself in the foot? As with most issues in a company, the problem lies with money! They are facing serious challenges in both the revenue stream as well as investor capital. Investor Capital 0:00 / 0:00 Even with the explosive growth, it’s not like investors are lining up for the fundraising. It would be a walk in the park to raise funding for any other company with its growth trajectory and profitability. But there are multiple challenges in the case of OnlyFans: Some VC funds are prohibited from investing in adult content as part of their partnership agreements. Even though OnlyFans has a verification process, the risk of minors creating subscription accounts is real and will do irreversible reputation damage for both the company and its investors. Even if the investors could look past all of this as the company looks to raise new funding at unicorn valuation, OnlyFans has a reputation problem. Even if the brand could move on to a “safe for work” platform, the history associated with the brand is synonymous with adult content. Given its history, it would be extremely difficult to attract brand partners and big names into the platform. The presence of big names is a must for a platform trying to become a more mainstream media site! Payment Processing While brand imaging and raising capital might be a longer-term problem for the company, the more pressing issue is a BBC investigation into how the company handles illegal content and its ramifications. If you thought Google had monopolistic power, let me introduce you to Visa and Mastercard combinedly process more than 90% of transactions and 75% of transaction volume of all Credit card purchases in the US. In Dec 2020, after a NY Times article about how P*rnHub monetizes illegal content, both Visa and Mastercard cut off payments to the site within 6 days! [1]. This caused them to remove 70% of all content (unverified) on their website (aka The Purge) to try and get the payment platforms on board. Visa and Mastercard still won’t work with the company even after all the drastic actions taken by P*rnHub. Given that the OnlyFans platform doesn’t show any ads, they would be dead in the water if their direct payment takes a hit. In April, Mastercard had announced a change to their policy [2] that requires this: The banks that connect merchants to our network... to certify that the seller of adult content has effective controls in place to monitor, block and, where necessary, take down all illegal content. The policy will come into effect on October 15th and OnlyFans is trying to be compliant by the time the policy is enforced [3] and it seems like they are going by the logic that desperate times require desperate measures [4]!   What now? The Billion dollar question is whether OnlyFans would go the way Tumblr went (Tumblr was once valued at $1.1B and was sold later for $3M) after they banned all adult content on their website. It seems that OnlyFan’s aspirations of becoming a mainstream media company and increasing regulations by payment partners are forcing the company to abandon the adult segment. While we currently don’t have an insight into their revenue split, it’s safe to say that a majority of it would be coming from the adult segment which would make the pivot even harder to pull off successfully. I don’t know a single company that has survived after throwing their most loyal userbase and revenue generators under the bus for greener pastures! Maybe they are just concerned about their short-term survival and were forced to make this decision. But dropping the same folks who made you popular in the first place is definitely going to leave a bad aftertaste. After all, what do we know?

,"One of the biggest pieces of business news last week was that OnlyFans was going to bar sexually explicit videos starting from October. After the initial uproar and wave of memes, there was a lot of discussion around why a company whose main income stream is from adult content decided to kill its golden goose.

Even if the investors could look past all of this as the company looks to raise new funding at unicorn valuation, OnlyFans has a reputation problem. Even if the brand could move on to a “safe for work” platform, the history associated with the brand is synonymous with adult content.

The presence of big names is a must for a platform trying to become a more mainstream media site! Payment Processing While brand imaging and raising capital might be a longer-term problem for the company, the more pressing issue is a BBC investigation into how the company handles illegal content and its ramifications. If you thought Google had monopolistic power, let me introduce you to Visa and Mastercard combinedly process more than 90% of transactions and 75% of transaction volume of all Credit card purchases in the US. In Dec 2020, after a NY Times article about how P*rnHub monetizes illegal content, both Visa and Mastercard cut off payments to the site within 6 days! [1]. This caused them to remove 70% of all content (unverified) on their website (aka The Purge) to try and get the payment platforms on board. Visa and Mastercard still won’t work with the company even after all the drastic actions taken by P*rnHub. Given that the OnlyFans platform doesn’t show any ads, they would be dead in the water if their direct payment takes a hit. In April, Mastercard had announced a change to their policy [2] that requires this: The banks that connect merchants to our network... to certify that the seller of adult content has effective controls in place to monitor, block and, where necessary, take down all illegal content. The policy will come into effect on October 15th and OnlyFans is trying to be compliant by the time the policy is enforced [3] and it seems like they are going by the logic that desperate times require desperate measures [4]!   What now? The Billion dollar question is whether OnlyFans would go the way Tumblr went (Tumblr was once valued at $1.1B and was sold later for $3M) after they banned all adult content on their website. It seems that OnlyFan’s aspirations of becoming a mainstream media company and increasing regulations by payment partners are forcing the company to abandon the adult segment. While we currently don’t have an insight into their revenue split, it’s safe to say that a majority of it would be coming from the adult segment which would make the pivot even harder to pull off successfully. I don’t know a single company that has survived after throwing their most loyal userbase and revenue generators under the bus for greener pastures!

,"One of the biggest pieces of business news last week was that OnlyFans was going to bar sexually explicit videos starting from October. After the initial uproar and wave of memes, there was a lot of discussion around why a company whose main income stream is from adult content decided to kill its golden goose. Was it because they are idiots, or because of any new regulations, or is there something much larger at play here? For this week’s analysis, I would be focusing on the company’s history and my take on why they did what they did and future implications for them. So, strap in while I take one for the team with my search history and ad recommendations going into questionable territory for the considerable future. The Company OnlyFans was launched by Timothy Stokely in 2016. His pitch was simple but effective. Why not create a platform that allows these entertainers to conveniently and securely monetize their content? OnlyFans would be like a social media platform with a feed, similar to that of Instagram and Twitter, except that fans are required to pay a monthly subscription to view the content of these entertainers. And if they are willing to pay more, they could unlock paywalls for even more valuable services. The company was extremely successful and now hosts more than 2 million content creators. It has a user base of 130 million. Even though the service is pitched as a website for content creators such as physical fitness experts, musicians, etc., it’s predominantly known for its adult entertainment category. The company had explosive growth during the pandemic with its revenue rising by 540% to reach $400MM. As per a leaked pitch deck obtained by Axios (ironically, the company never mentions p*rn in its pitch deck), it’s expected to create a whopping $2.5B in revenue by 2022. The Problem So, if the growth is great and the user base is becoming more and more engaged, why did the company decide to shoot itself in the foot? As with most issues in a company, the problem lies with money! They are facing serious challenges in both the revenue stream as well as investor capital. Investor Capital 0:00 / 0:00 Even with the explosive growth, it’s not like investors are lining up for the fundraising.

This caused them to remove 70% of all content (unverified) on their website (aka The Purge) to try and get the payment platforms on board. Visa and Mastercard still won’t work with the company even after all the drastic actions taken by P*rnHub. Given that the OnlyFans platform doesn’t show any ads, they would be dead in the water if their direct payment takes a hit. In April, Mastercard had announced a change to their policy [2] that requires this: The banks that connect merchants to our network... to certify that the seller of adult content has effective controls in place to monitor, block and, where necessary, take down all illegal content. The policy will come into effect on October 15th and OnlyFans is trying to be compliant by the time the policy is enforced [3] and it seems like they are going by the logic that desperate times require desperate measures [4]!   What now? The Billion dollar question is whether OnlyFans would go the way Tumblr went (Tumblr was once valued at $1.1B and was sold later for $3M) after they banned all adult content on their website. It seems that OnlyFan’s aspirations of becoming a mainstream media company and increasing regulations by payment partners are forcing the company to abandon the adult segment. While we currently don’t have an insight into their revenue split, it’s safe to say that a majority of it would be coming from the adult segment which would make the pivot even harder to pull off successfully. I don’t know a single company that has survived after throwing their most loyal userbase and revenue generators under the bus for greener pastures! Maybe they are just concerned about their short-term survival and were forced to make this decision. But dropping the same folks who made you popular in the first place is definitely going to leave a bad aftertaste. After all, what do we know? Running a billion-dollar company is a very serious business! Until next week! Footnotes [1] This would cause all normal credit card transactions to fail and then the only way for them to charge would be to directly get paid to their bank accounts or via crypto, both of which would be extremely difficult to process and scale.

,"One of the biggest pieces of business news last week was that OnlyFans was going to bar sexually explicit videos starting from October. After the initial uproar and wave of memes, there was a lot of discussion around why a company whose main income stream is from adult content decided to kill its golden goose. Was it because they are idiots, or because of any new regulations, or is there something much larger at play here? For this week’s analysis, I would be focusing on the company’s history and my take on why they did what they did and future implications for them. So, strap in while I take one for the team with my search history and ad recommendations going into questionable territory for the considerable future. The Company OnlyFans was launched by Timothy Stokely in 2016. His pitch was simple but effective. Why not create a platform that allows these entertainers to conveniently and securely monetize their content? OnlyFans would be like a social media platform with a feed, similar to that of Instagram and Twitter, except that fans are required to pay a monthly subscription to view the content of these entertainers. And if they are willing to pay more, they could unlock paywalls for even more valuable services. The company was extremely successful and now hosts more than 2 million content creators. It has a user base of 130 million. Even though the service is pitched as a website for content creators such as physical fitness experts, musicians, etc., it’s predominantly known for its adult entertainment category. The company had explosive growth during the pandemic with its revenue rising by 540% to reach $400MM. As per a leaked pitch deck obtained by Axios (ironically, the company never mentions p*rn in its pitch deck), it’s expected to create a whopping $2.5B in revenue by 2022. The Problem So, if the growth is great and the user base is becoming more and more engaged, why did the company decide to shoot itself in the foot? As with most issues in a company, the problem lies with money! They are facing serious challenges in both the revenue stream as well as investor capital. Investor Capital 0:00 / 0:00 Even with the explosive growth, it’s not like investors are lining up for the fundraising. It would be a walk in the park to raise funding for any other company with its growth trajectory and profitability. But there are multiple challenges in the case of OnlyFans: Some VC funds are prohibited from investing in adult content as part of their partnership agreements. Even though OnlyFans has a verification process, the risk of minors creating subscription accounts is real and will do irreversible reputation damage for both the company and its investors. Even if the investors could look past all of this as the company looks to raise new funding at unicorn valuation, OnlyFans has a reputation problem. Even if the brand could move on to a “safe for work” platform, the history associated with the brand is synonymous with adult content. Given its history, it would be extremely difficult to attract brand partners and big names into the platform. The presence of big names is a must for a platform trying to become a more mainstream media site! Payment Processing While brand imaging and raising capital might be a longer-term problem for the company, the more pressing issue is a BBC investigation into how the company handles illegal content and its ramifications.

While we currently don’t have an insight into their revenue split, it’s safe to say that a majority of it would be coming from the adult segment which would make the pivot even harder to pull off successfully. I don’t know a single company that has survived after throwing their most loyal userbase and revenue generators under the bus for greener pastures! Maybe they are just concerned about their short-term survival and were forced to make this decision. But dropping the same folks who made you popular in the first place is definitely going to leave a bad aftertaste. After all, what do we know? Running a billion-dollar company is a very serious business! Until next week! Footnotes [1] This would cause all normal credit card transactions to fail and then the only way for them to charge would be to directly get paid to their bank accounts or via crypto, both of which would be extremely difficult to process and scale. [2] While there is a lot of chatter around how certain groups lobbied Mastercard to change their policy, I am not getting into that as it would inevitably take a political turn. [3] To put this into perspective, if 4 companies (Visa, Mastercard, AmEx, and Discover) cut off your payment pipeline, you would effectively have no way to charge your customer! [4] There is a lot of conversation around how this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for crypto to shine with the decentralized payment system. [5] Granted, they were already seeing reduced engagement prior to the ban, but the adult content ban was the final nail in the coffin! This is a hilarious parody video of Tumblr CEO explaining the ban! [6]Apologies for filtering out all the adult words as I didn’t want to get tagged in spam filters. As always, please note that I am not a financial advisor. Hope you enjoyed this week’s analysis.",There goes the business plan. Start over.,0,0.579,POSITIVE,0.984
