,"PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, April 28, 2021 The stock market fell on Wednesday, with all three major indexes closing modestly red as market participants continue to digest the corporate earnings season and new commentary from the Federal Open Markets Committee. The FOMC said the effective distribution of the vaccine in the US has improved economic conditions but reiterated interest rates will remain near-zero and the asset purchasing program in place. The Fed said, “Amid progress and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have risen.” The committee remains optimistic about the rebound in economic activity, describing the most affected sectors as “having shown improvement”, but shows no signs of slowing quantitative easing or raising interest rates. With more than 8 million people still out of jobs compared to pre-pandemic levels, FOMC reiterated its commitment to supporting the economy. The Fed also said inflation has “risen” but attributed the higher readings to “transitory factors”, meaning they expect any rise in inflationary pressures to be short-lived. Central bank officials warn that higher inflation reading could be coming as a result of measuring year-over-year changes from a highly unusual 2020. In other words, The Fed looks at changes in prices in a year-over-year format. Data for March and April of this year could therefore reflect large price “increases” because they are being compared against March and April in 2020 that saw massive price drops. Economic data published since the Fed’s last meeting in March 17 have largely supported their brighter outlook. Consumer spending surged 9.8% in March and initial jobless claims dropped to pandemic-era lows as more states continue reopening measures. In other news, according to a report by the Conference Board, consumer confidence has surged to a 14-month high in April as effective distribution of the vaccine and easing of social distancing guidelines in the US allows for the economy to gradually reopen. The Conference Board's monthly consumer confidence index jumped to a reading of 121.7 in April, or well above the 113.0 expected. Lynn Franco, senior director of economic indicators at the Conference Board, said in a statement, “Consumers’ assessment of current conditions improved significantly in April, suggesting the economic recovery strengthened further in early Q2. Consumers’ optimism about the short-term outlook held steady this month. Consumers were more upbeat about their income prospects, perhaps due to the improving job market and the recent round of stimulus checks.” Highlights The US trade deficit rose to a new record high in March, according to data from the Department of Commerce.

,"PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, April 28, 2021 The stock market fell on Wednesday, with all three major indexes closing modestly red as market participants continue to digest the corporate earnings season and new commentary from the Federal Open Markets Committee. The FOMC said the effective distribution of the vaccine in the US has improved economic conditions but reiterated interest rates will remain near-zero and the asset purchasing program in place. The Fed said, “Amid progress and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have risen.” The committee remains optimistic about the rebound in economic activity, describing the most affected sectors as “having shown improvement”, but shows no signs of slowing quantitative easing or raising interest rates. With more than 8 million people still out of jobs compared to pre-pandemic levels, FOMC reiterated its commitment to supporting the economy. The Fed also said inflation has “risen” but attributed the higher readings to “transitory factors”, meaning they expect any rise in inflationary pressures to be short-lived. Central bank officials warn that higher inflation reading could be coming as a result of measuring year-over-year changes from a highly unusual 2020. In other words, The Fed looks at changes in prices in a year-over-year format. Data for March and April of this year could therefore reflect large price “increases” because they are being compared against March and April in 2020 that saw massive price drops. Economic data published since the Fed’s last meeting in March 17 have largely supported their brighter outlook. Consumer spending surged 9.8% in March and initial jobless claims dropped to pandemic-era lows as more states continue reopening measures. In other news, according to a report by the Conference Board, consumer confidence has surged to a 14-month high in April as effective distribution of the vaccine and easing of social distancing guidelines in the US allows for the economy to gradually reopen. The Conference Board's monthly consumer confidence index jumped to a reading of 121.7 in April, or well above the 113.0 expected. Lynn Franco, senior director of economic indicators at the Conference Board, said in a statement, “Consumers’ assessment of current conditions improved significantly in April, suggesting the economic recovery strengthened further in early Q2. Consumers’ optimism about the short-term outlook held steady this month. Consumers were more upbeat about their income prospects, perhaps due to the improving job market and the recent round of stimulus checks.” Highlights The US trade deficit rose to a new record high in March, according to data from the Department of Commerce.
