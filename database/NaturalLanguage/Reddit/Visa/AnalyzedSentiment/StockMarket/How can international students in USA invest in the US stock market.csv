,"Hello everyone, I am an international student and trying to start investing in US soon. I do not know which brokerage is going to accept international students with expired F-1 visa, but still legally in US on school paperwork. I found Merrill, but they will keep your account while your visa is not expired. I was thinking of e*trade app or stash app, but I am not sure how legal would that be since I know that we (international students) have to fill out an additional form (forgot which one) for IRS. Does anyone have experience with this? Any suggestions?","Hello!
