,"The bullish DailyPlay we chose for Thursday, May 24th is Visa (V). V is part of the Technology Sector (XLK). Over the last month, XLK has experienced a 7.81% move higher and its 1m/6m trend has turned bullish on 5/4 and recently broke above its $69 resistance level which now becomes support. Visa's 1m and 6m trends turned bullish on 4/26 and recently broke above its $129 resistance level which becomes support. With a technical score of 8 (out of 10), V is a strong bullish stock that will likely continue higher. View this Trade Idea on V As a stop loss, if V was to trade below $129 for multiple days, this would invalidate our analysis and suggest getting out of the trade.
