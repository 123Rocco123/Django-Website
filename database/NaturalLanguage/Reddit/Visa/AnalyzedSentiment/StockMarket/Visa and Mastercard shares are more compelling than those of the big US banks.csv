Thanks for the silver award!!","FWIW LTM P/E is sitting at 36. It’s growing at about 10-15% per year. Attaching Ben Grahams PE formula (Growth x 2) + 8.5% (I know, value investor not growth, but hear me out) suggest the PE should be 28.5 to 38.5. Then one should account for the acquisitions they’ve made this year which will boost NTM P/E. so the PE appears to be in range of what’s reasonable.Another way one could value is DCF. Under a DCF Visa will have a very low discount rate because it’s future cashflow is seen as very predictable and it has amazing credit (incl a 70% EBITDA margin!). It also is expected to grow for long term, raising expected cashflow.I think it’s actually reasonable when you consider these factors. Would I like it to sit around 30 PE? Yes, I would buy more. But I think it’s still a hold at 36.",2,0.542,NEGATIVE,1.0

Thanks for the silver award!!","If you're referring to OP's post, the idea is that Visa and Mastercard aren't banks. They don't give loans. Your credit card is issued by your bank, and you're given a credit account by the bank. Visa/Mastercard are companies that just allow you to make transactions with the card - they don't hold any of the actual loans. They're just a middleman that takes a small cut of the transaction you make between your bank's credit account and the seller's account. That's why OP's saying Visa etc isn't nearly as risky - it's because when shit hits the fan like 2008, they're not screwed because they don't deal in loans that could go default (and did go default back in 2008).",1,0.511,NEGATIVE,0.999
