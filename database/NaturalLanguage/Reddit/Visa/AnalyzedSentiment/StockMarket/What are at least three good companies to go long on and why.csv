,I'm thinking Visa Square Walmart,Why Lockheed as opposed to Boeing?,1,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.749
,I'm thinking Visa Square Walmart,"Right now, their 737-MAX is having issues and their is evidence Boeing knew about the issue and potentially its severity before it caused the Lion air crash. Considering Boeing only makes money on 737s and some 777s (talking commercial product planes only) as well as their overpriced stock, they are a fantastic short candidate. They have been clearing out top talent for years and there are rumors that 777X is WAY over budget. Also, for fun take a look into their “program accounting” method that was cleared by the SEC. it’s very similar to when the SEC let Enron do mark to market.So say the 777X was supposed to cost $100 this year, well because the plane won’t technically sell for another 3-5 years let’s spread the cost over that time frame, so now $100 in expenses this year looks like $20 short term liabilities with another $80 long term.This is why Boeing always has like $100billion in revenue but single digit profit margins.Luckily, Boeing is pretty much a monopoly on the commercial side because they only have to compete against the French.",2,0.539,NEGATIVE,0.605

If he’s willing to put his face on the product, I’m willing to take a long term position in it.Lockheed Martin is definitely a good choice though I would wait for the dip on this one.

Reasoning: their chips are on par with nVidia for the first time in decades, more commercial entities are taking advantage of their offerings (like Amazon building datacenters with their Epyc chips), and they've got a great debt-to-profit ratio relative to other companies in the industry.UFS - Domtar makes paper products mainly, but also has a fairly extensive healthcare amenities segment.
