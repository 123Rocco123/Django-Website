,"Hey there guys, I would like to here your opinions on the below strategy, as i am fairly new to investing and trading, as a whole. Ive been thinking into putting some money into a few stocks, before their earnings come up, with the hope that the price will pump up a bit, before that. After a short research i shortened the list to: Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX) The Blackstone Group Inc. (BX) Visa Inc. (V) Eli Lilly and Company (LLY) Cardinal Health, Inc. (CAH) AbbVie Inc. (ABBV) Humana Inc. (HUM) I have also thought about buying into Netflix and Amazon, but since they are at all time highs and there's not much time left till their earnings i doubt that there is any profit to be made there.","People doesn't understand recession, let's all gather our money and buy shares from the stock market, and we call wallstreetbets the irrational one's jeez.",0,0.561,NEGATIVE,0.999

Buying stock during a recession isn't an bad idea but this is a recession where the shares are riding near all time high. Now even a dumbass from Wallstreetbets would do that.",1,0.56,NEGATIVE,1.0
