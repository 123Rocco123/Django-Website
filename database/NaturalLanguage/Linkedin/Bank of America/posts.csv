It wrote: “From 2000 to 2007, large banks and thrifts generally had $16 to $22 in assets for each dollar of capital, for leverage ratios between 16:1 and 22:1. For some banks, leverage remained roughly constant. JP Morgan’s reported leverage was between 20:1 and 22:1. Wells Fargo’s generally ranged between 16:1 and 17:1. Other banks upped their leverage. Bank of America’s rose from 18:1 in 2000 to 27:1 in 2007. Citigroup’s increased from 18:1 to 22:1, then shot up to 32:1 by the end of 2007, when Citi brought off-balance sheet assets onto the balance sheet. More than other banks, Citigroup held assets off of its balance sheet, in part to hold down capital requirements. In 2007, even after bringing $80 billion worth of assets on balance sheet, substantial assets remained off. If those had been included, leverage in 2007 would have been 48:1, or about 53% higher. In comparison, at Wells Fargo and Bank of America, including off-balance-sheet assets would have raised the 2007 leverage ratios 17% and 28%, respectively",0.5264,NEGATIVE,0.9998

10/12/2024,Pratibha Kumari J.,Chief Digital Officer @ DataThick | Results-driven Chief Digital Officer,"Mastering AI and Machine Learning with Clean and Accurate Data - https://lnkd.in/gFcN2_2D In today's data-driven landscape, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are at the forefront of business innovation. However, the real value of these technologies is deeply tied to the quality of the data they rely on. Clean and accurate data is the foundation for building effective AI models that can deliver reliable insights and decision-making power.  Why Data Quality Matters AI and ML algorithms are only as good as the data they are fed. Poor-quality data can lead to flawed models that produce inaccurate or biased predictions. Clean, well-structured, and accurate data ensures that these models are trained properly, providing the clarity needed for businesses to make strategic decisions.  Common Data Quality Issues -  Incomplete data : Missing values can skew model predictions. -  Duplicate records : These can inflate patterns and distort trends. -  Inconsistent formatting : Differing date formats, units of measurement, or categorizations can lead to incorrect interpretations. -  Outliers and anomalies : Extreme values can throw off model accuracy, leading to overfitting.  The Path to Clean Data To master AI and ML, companies must implement strong data cleaning and preprocessing practices: -  Data cleansing : Removing inconsistencies, fixing errors, and filling in gaps. -  Normalization and standardization : Ensuring data is uniform and usable across systems. -  Feature engineering : Enhancing the predictive power of data by creating new variables that capture underlying patterns.  Data Governance and Validation Ensuring data quality isn’t just a one-time effort. Continuous  data governance  and  validation  processes are critical for maintaining high standards. By using tools like  Pandas ,  Trifacta , or  Alteryx , organizations can streamline the data cleaning process, making data preparation faster and more accurate.  The Impact of Clean Data on AI Success In industries like healthcare, finance, and retail, high-quality data allows AI models to detect fraud, predict customer behavior, and personalize services more effectively. For instance, a financial services firm using clean transactional data was able to boost the accuracy of their fraud detection model by 35%—a direct testament to the power of accurate data.  Conclusion For businesses to truly unlock the potential of AI and ML, clean and accurate data is non-negotiable. As AI technologies advance, the emphasis on data quality will only grow. By focusing on high-quality data, organizations can ensure their AI initiatives drive real value and provide actionable insights for the future.",0.5341,NEGATIVE,0.918

The conference call included a 19-page PowerPoint.  How bereft was TD of AML professionals? TD Bank has apparently hired 40 new ""leaders"" and 700 new AML specialists (see slide 4). At $750,000 per leader, and $100,000 per specialist, that's $100 million.  The asset cap is the real penalty. And it comes with costs, as explained on slide 7:  $ 200,000,000 - reduced NII $ 500,000,000 - ""repositioning"" (?) the portfolio $1,500,000,000 - doing some hokey-pokey accounting with assets $ 500,000,000 - governance and control costs  The monitors and consultants (SAR lookback and AML program), lawyers, and other hangers-on and vultures will likely add another $300,000,000.  That gets TD to ... $3,100,000,000 which matches the net amounts of the fines and forfeitures.  $6.2 billion and counting.  PS - Apparently TD's consultants and lawyers were laser-focused on crafting the PowerPoint. They should now turn to other public documents.

A stronger-than-expected September jobs report has pushed Wall Street's debate over how deeply the Fed will cut interest rates at its November meeting in favour of a more modest path. Some have even suggested the report could mean the Fed won't cut rates at all next month. Odds that the Fed will cut by a total of 50 basis point this year rise to 73% from 44% Thursday, while odds of 75-bps in cuts fall to 25% from 45%, CME data show. Bets on a 50-bps trim in November are down to 9%, from 32% Thursday.

Herein, I continue from last week's post with Part 2 on the ongoing confusion between governance and culture, and offer a new framework for culture risk governance.  When seeking to demonstrate that they have achieved an effective non-financial risk management posture, bank risk leaders typically point to alignment between their internal policies and regulatory expectations. They then highlight their related processes, operated through robust governance structures and systems of control.  But between policies and processes (let’s call them ‘governance inputs’), and the costly outcomes that are later seen (‘performance outputs’), much poorly understood activity takes place (‘operational throughputs’). These operational throughputs are as essential to the success of risk governance as are the more immediately tangible policies and processes, but because this activity is less formalized, it is less well recognized.  To truly manage non-financial risk, we must understand:  -People: The informal networks through which work actually happens -Presumptions: The often conflicting presumptions that guide executive decision-making -Practices: The real practices that emerge, sometimes contrary to stated policies  Incorporating these elements alongside governance inputs and performance outputs completes the diagnostic framework and represents a fundamentally different way of approaching risk. Executives looking to improve their organization's culture risk governance capabilities would do well to take note.",0.5171,NEGATIVE,0.668

Since September 2022, the central bank has reported losses of around $176.4 billion. If it was a real company, it would be considered bankrupt.  Fortunately for the Fed, it gets to make up its own accounting rules. Unfortunately for you the taxpayer, you're going to pay for the central bank's losses.  Why is the Fed losing so much money?  It's a function of interest rates.  Since the Fed hiked rates to battle price inflation, it has been paying commercial banks more for the reserves it holds on their behalf. Meanwhile, earnings on the assets held on its balance sheets have decreased.  Wall Street on Parade reported that commercial banks have been earning 5.4 percent on their reserves at the Fed for nearly a year.  ""A significant part of that generous payout has been going to megabanks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America. ... These megabanks aren’t passing along that generosity to their customers’ savings accounts, since those savings accounts continue to pay the preposterously low rate of 0.01 percent interest, despite 11 rate hikes by the Fed since 2022.""",0.5344,NEGATIVE,1.0

The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank sparked a panic that led to massive deposit withdrawals from FRC.

It wrote: “From 2000 to 2007, large banks and thrifts generally had $16 to $22 in assets for each dollar of capital, for leverage ratios between 16:1 and 22:1. For some banks, leverage remained roughly constant. JP Morgan’s reported leverage was between 20:1 and 22:1. Wells Fargo’s generally ranged between 16:1 and 17:1. Other banks upped their leverage. Bank of America’s rose from 18:1 in 2000 to 27:1 in 2007. Citigroup’s increased from 18:1 to 22:1, then shot up to 32:1 by the end of 2007, when Citi brought off-balance sheet assets onto the balance sheet. More than other banks, Citigroup held assets off of its balance sheet, in part to hold down capital requirements. In 2007, even after bringing $80 billion worth of assets on balance sheet, substantial assets remained off. If those had been included, leverage in 2007 would have been 48:1, or about 53% higher. In comparison, at Wells Fargo and Bank of America, including off-balance-sheet assets would have raised the 2007 leverage ratios 17% and 28%, respectively",0.5264,NEGATIVE,0.9998

The conference call included a 19-page PowerPoint.  How bereft was TD of AML professionals? TD Bank has apparently hired 40 new ""leaders"" and 700 new AML specialists (see slide 4). At $750,000 per leader, and $100,000 per specialist, that's $100 million.  The asset cap is the real penalty. And it comes with costs, as explained on slide 7:  $ 200,000,000 - reduced NII $ 500,000,000 - ""repositioning"" (?) the portfolio $1,500,000,000 - doing some hokey-pokey accounting with assets $ 500,000,000 - governance and control costs  The monitors and consultants (SAR lookback and AML program), lawyers, and other hangers-on and vultures will likely add another $300,000,000.  That gets TD to ... $3,100,000,000 which matches the net amounts of the fines and forfeitures.  $6.2 billion and counting.  PS - Apparently TD's consultants and lawyers were laser-focused on crafting the PowerPoint. They should now turn to other public documents. For example, the executive bio of TD's Chief Risk Officer provides: ""In his role, he is accountable for oversight of Risk Management for TD's Global operations. Previously, he served as Chief Risk Officer for TD Bank, America's Most Convenient Bank."" See(accessed October 12, 2024).

Herein, I continue from last week's post with Part 2 on the ongoing confusion between governance and culture, and offer a new framework for culture risk governance.  When seeking to demonstrate that they have achieved an effective non-financial risk management posture, bank risk leaders typically point to alignment between their internal policies and regulatory expectations. They then highlight their related processes, operated through robust governance structures and systems of control.  But between policies and processes (let’s call them ‘governance inputs’), and the costly outcomes that are later seen (‘performance outputs’), much poorly understood activity takes place (‘operational throughputs’). These operational throughputs are as essential to the success of risk governance as are the more immediately tangible policies and processes, but because this activity is less formalized, it is less well recognized.  To truly manage non-financial risk, we must understand:  -People: The informal networks through which work actually happens -Presumptions: The often conflicting presumptions that guide executive decision-making -Practices: The real practices that emerge, sometimes contrary to stated policies  Incorporating these elements alongside governance inputs and performance outputs completes the diagnostic framework and represents a fundamentally different way of approaching risk. Executives looking to improve their organization's culture risk governance capabilities would do well to take note.",0.5171,NEGATIVE,0.668
