The research shows that since 2000, U.S. manufacturing jobs have declined, and output has been flat. However, foreign-owned factory investments have increased substantially with the foreign direct investment (FDI) position in manufacturing more than doubling in the past 10 years. Since COVID, the number of “billion dollar factories” supported with foreign direct investment has tripled. These Large FDI projects are concentrated in three sectors – semiconductors, chemicals, and automotive.  The rise in FDI and large foreign-owned factory projects matters because foreign-owned factories typically invest more in technology than their U.S. peers.
