2024-12-03,Deepak gupta,Technical Author at TechShali,"Through a simple press release, Intel has announced that Pat GelsingerCEO of the company for the last three years and who arrived to ‚Äúsave it at a bad time‚Äù, is no longer the top leader. The curious thing about this is that no one seems to be clear if it is Intel who has terminated Gelsinger, if they have ‚Äúinvited him to retire‚Äù or if it was he himself who has resigned, but the fact is that the future of the company is now more uncertain than ever.   With the ‚Äúexit‚Äù of Pat Gelsinger, the company has released a press release announcing that the company‚Äôs leadership has also been temporarily restructured, and has named two temporary co-CEOs: David Zinsner (as executive vice president and chief financial officer (CFO)) and Michelle Johnston Holthaus (as CEO of the newly created ‚ÄúIntel Products‚Äù division). Intel without Pat Gelsinger, more lost than ever Not even a month ago, Intel declared the largest losses ever recorded by the company: $16.6 billion. After this disaster, the company decided to ‚Äúlighten up‚Äù and laid off 15,000 employees while making several adjustments to try to mitigate these financial problems, making it clear that, of course, things were not going well for them.   But things weren‚Äôt going very well before either, and in fact Pat Gelsinger came to Intel a little over three years ago to try to revive a company that was failing‚Ä¶ although it seems that, in the end, things haven‚Äôt gone as expected. seen what has been seen. Of course, in the press release, the company has not attributed the departure of its CEO to any of these reasons. In fact, before Pat Gelsinger left he did leave some guidelines to ‚Äúsave‚Äù the company in 2025, such as simplifying the product catalog, improving organizational efficiency and focusing on the development of its Intel 18A node. The plan that Gelsinger presented when he was promoted as the company‚Äôs top executive seemed quite good, and a good future was predicted; But of course, that‚Äôs what they always say when they name a new CEO. Now we will see if the company‚Äôs new co-CEOs decide to follow in the wake that Gelsinger has left or not, but what is clear is that after his more than 40 years in the company, it is not that his 3 years as CEO are going to make a difference. no milestone‚Ä¶ at least not positive. The AI train, the main culprit? It is clear that Intel has missed the AI train and it is going to be very difficult for them to catch it again, especially given the advantage that other competing companies are taking from them, and this is a very important point because‚Ä¶ well , because you know, it‚Äôs the trendy topic, right? Everyone knows that NVIDIA has taken the lead in this area (with permission from TSMC, who got involved even before), and although we all expected that a company with the importance, budget and renown of Intel would immediately take behind, in reality it was not like that.

2024-12-03,Puneet Singh,"VP, Engineering, MemryX","Pat's departure from Intel has left many of us wondering about the reasons. While we can speculate on the reason, we can all agree that the latest disruption for Intel was its lag/miss on AI. This wasn't due to lack of investment (Habana, Nervana, Granulate) or inhouse foundational capability in Datacenter/GPU - so what was amiss?  AI disrupts the traditional compute workload, its critical for companies to ensure the HW/SW design truly works best for this new workload and seamlessly integrates into the AI ECO system - choice of the HW architecture and the accompanying SW stack defines adoption and success thereby.  Lessons we can learn from Intel's previous misstep in mobile - the Fab ecosystem grew stronger than Intel's as market competition, investment and innovation provided the winds behind TSMC's sails. Great technology misaligned with the ecosystem cannot flourish.  We're still in early stages of AI with cloud vs edge, training vs inferencing, and customization for different types of AI workloads/models yet to shape their market. History is proof that technology always evolves and companies sometimes reinvent themselves to come back much stronger.

The team has successfully increased the yield rate of test chips by 6%, which can ""create billions of dollars for the company's customers"" cost savings‚Äù.  Tomshardware reported that a TSMC employee who called himself Dr. Kim did not disclose whether the foundry has improved the yield of SRAM test wafers or logic test wafers. TSMC will only begin providing shuttle test wafer services for 2nm technology in January next year, and is unlikely to increase the production of actual chip prototypes that will eventually be manufactured with 2nm. Improving the yield of SRAM and logic test wafers is really important because ultimately it saves customers a lot of costs and thus benefits from higher yields.  TSMC's N2 will be the company's first to use gate-all-around (GAA) nanosheet transistors, which are expected to significantly reduce power consumption and increase performance and transistor density. In particular, TSMC's GAA nanosheet transistors are not only smaller than 3nm FinFET transistors, but also enable smaller, high-density SRAM bit cells by providing improved static control and reduced leakage without affecting performance.  Wafers manufactured using N2 manufacturing technology are expected to consume between 25% and 30% less power than wafers manufactured using N3E at the same transistor count and frequency, and provide 10% to 15% less power at the same transistor count and power. % performance improvement and a 15% increase in transistor density compared to N3E-made semiconductors while maintaining the same speed and power.  In early May this year, when TSMC‚Äôs 2024 Technology Forum was held in Taiwan, Zhang Xiaoqiang, senior vice president of business development and deputy co-chief operating officer, said that the 2-nanometer process using innovative nanosheets (Nanosheet) was progressing ‚Äúvery smoothly‚Äù.

When I first entered the field, Intel was the benchmark that every other company aspired to emulate.  Intel possesses invaluable assets: semiconductor fabrication lines that require billions of dollars and years to construct, along with a team of world-class engineers.  So how did we arrive at this point? Their core business of general-purpose CPUs has become significantly less profitable. But the strategic options for moving away from this business have put Intel between a rock and a hard place. They could pivot towards GPUs, which represent much of the growth and profit within the industry right now.

The semiconductor is divided into two types: intrinsic and extrinsic semiconductors. _________________________________________ Why do we need extrinsic semiconductors?  The major purpose of extrinsic semiconductors is to better the conductivity of a semiconductor material, this is done by carrying out doping i.e. adding a small amount of impurity to a pure semiconductor.   What is doping ü§î?  What doping really does is to alter the electrical properties of the semiconductor by introducing an impurity atom into its crystal lattice, this impurities modifies the number of free charge carriers(electron or holes), thereby increasing the ability of the materials to conduct electricity.  _________________________________________  Compound semiconductors???  These are semiconductors that are made from two or more elements in the period table. This semiconductor exhibits unique electrical, optical and physical property, some examples of compound semiconductors are:  Gallium Nitride(GaN) which is used in advanced lighting technology and laser diodes.  Cadmium Telluride (cdTe) which is used in X-ray and gamma ray detection systems and it's also employed in photovoltaic panels for large scale solar energy production. Gallium Arsenide(GaAs) which are used in high frequency and high speed electronic devices.  Why all these?

2024-12-03,Marius Pantea,"Founder, Business Developer, and Entrepreneur @ Consulting Intermediary Agency Ltd","In a significant geopolitical move, China has announced a ban on the export of key minerals‚Äîgallium, germanium, and antimony‚Äîto the United States. This decision comes as a direct response to ongoing chip sanctions and intensifying trade tensions between the two nations.  Gallium and germanium are essential components in the semiconductor industry, playing a critical role in the production of advanced technologies ranging from mobile devices to electric vehicles. Antimony is used in flame retardants and various alloys. The restrictions on these materials could potentially impact the supply chain of numerous tech companies and lead to increased costs in an already strained global market.  This development not only underscores the fragility of our current technological supply chains but also highlights the growing importance of strategic resources in international relations. As the U.S. continues its efforts to secure its semiconductor industry, countries like China are likely to leverage their own resources as bargaining chips.  For businesses reliant on these materials, it‚Äôs a wake-up call to diversify supply chains and explore alternative sources. Companies must be proactive in assessing their vulnerabilities and adapting to this changing landscape.  As we navigate these turbulent times, collaboration and innovation will be essential. The tech community now faces the challenge of finding sustainable solutions in light of these sanctions. Partnerships with alternative suppliers and investments in domestic production capabilities may prove vital to maintaining progress in technology development.

By modulating , the speakers create high-fidelity sound in a light and compact device. The clarity of sound that the new silicon-and- , , produces is more like that of a smartphone speaker‚Äîdecent, but far from the sound quality of in-ear alternatives. And like a smartphone speaker, Sycamore is intended for open-air audio produced by devices near or on the body. In particular, the speaker could be used in various wearable devices, like smart watches, XR glasses, or open earbuds, which clip around the ear instead of nestling within it.  ‚ñ™Ô∏èFor these applications, the advantage of using MEMS drivers instead of a conventional speaker is less about sound quality, and more about size. The microspeaker is about 1 thick, one-third the thickness of a coil driver, and removing the magnetic coils of conventional speakers brings its weight down by roughly 70 percent to 150 milligrams. Other speakers also require empty space behind the diaphragm, called back volume. The MEMS-based speakers significantly reduce the back volume needed.  ‚ñ™Ô∏èFor wearables, every millimeter and milligram matters; a heavy or bulky design could deter users, says Mike Housholder, xMEMS‚Äô vice president of marketing and business development. That‚Äôs why the microspeakers are ‚Äúperfect for smart watches.‚Äù Users seeking excellent audio quality would likely opt for in-ear buds or over-ear headphones. The thin, open-air microspeakers instead help deliver a sleek, ‚Äúfashion-forward‚Äù product, Housholder says.

This approach demonstrates the power of modularity in hardware design. üí° Design Approach: Step 1: Use a 1-to-2 demux for the initial level of selection. Step 2: Further divide each output using another 1-to-2 demux. Step 3: Repeat until 8 outputs are achieved. The select lines are distributed hierarchically to control the cascading structure. ‚öôÔ∏è Why It Matters: Decomposing larger circuits into smaller, reusable components simplifies design and testing while maintaining scalability. üìò Takeaway: Building complex logic from simpler units is a key principle in digital design. Techniques like this improve hardware efficiency and promote a deeper understanding of RTL concepts.  üëâ check my github repo for the verilog code:  üëâ Hope you learnt something today",0.5136,POSITIVE,0.8175

The announcement of CEO Pat Gelsinger‚Äôs retirement after more than 40 years is not just the end of an era but a reflection of Intel‚Äôs challenge to bring back its earlier success. Once the industry‚Äôs leader, Intel is now fighting to stay relevant in a world where the rules have shifted, competitors are faster, and the challenges are bigger. Massive investments in AI chips and chip production show Intel's push for reinvention, but the real question is: will it be enough?  In its prime years between 1994 and 2001, Intel‚Äôs revenue grew at a robust 14.82%, with an operating margin of 30.68%. Fast-forward to the period from 2012 to 2021, and revenue growth had slowed to 3.88%, although margins remained solid. By 2022-2024, however, the reality of decline emerged: revenue shrank by 11.31%, and operating margins plummeted to a mere 1.69%, according to Damodaran (2024). These numbers reveal a company once dominant, now wrestling with age and fierce competition.  At $18.89 per share on September 8, 2024, Intel presents potential value for patient investors. With even modest revenue growth of 6% and a 20% operating margin, its intrinsic value could rise to $20.85 per share or more, offering an appealing opportunity for those prioritizing resilience over high growth, according to Damodaran (2024). The stock recently hit a support level of $18.50, a price range it last saw in 2010-2012. After declining nearly 73% from March 2021 to September 2024, it rebounded from $18.50, yielding a return of nearly 36% in under three months.  Intel's aim to compete with Nvidia in AI and TSMC in manufacturing, markets where it may not lead, but can still find a profitable niche. Companies like Intel show us that success is not just about growth, but how well they adapt and continue to deliver value. Pat Gelsinger‚Äôs departure ends one chapter, but Intel‚Äôs reinvention continues.  To succeed, Intel must focus on operational efficiency, avoid chasing unsustainable growth, and prioritize disciplined EPS growth through strategic buybacks, which can help boost EPS, particularly when reinvestment options are limited. In my opinion, rather than pursuing aggressive expansion, Intel should focus on long-term value and profitability. Sometimes growth is not about chasing new markets, rather it is about holding on to the market share and building on existing expertise.  Still, there is reason to be optimistic about Intel‚Äôs future!

Thank you so much for understanding!),"The Latest US-China Semiconductor Battle: A Lose-Lose Game for Global Tech  The new US export restrictions targeting 140+ Chinese semiconductor companies reflect a concerning trend in global tech politics. While national security concerns are valid, these restrictions risk fragmenting the global semiconductor ecosystem that took decades to build.  The automotive sector stands as a prime example of potential collateral damage. Modern EVs require up to 1,600 chips - nearly triple the amount in traditional vehicles. This supply chain disruption could slow down global EV adoption and innovation.  Most concerning is the potential emergence of two separate semiconductor ecosystems - one US-led, one China-led. This bifurcation would increase costs, reduce efficiency, and potentially create incompatible standards that could hinder technological progress for everyone.  The semiconductor industry thrives on global collaboration. Rather than restrictions, perhaps the focus should be on establishing transparent international frameworks that address security concerns while preserving innovation.

2024-12-03,Marius Pantea,"Founder, Business Developer, and Entrepreneur @ Consulting Intermediary Agency Ltd","In light of the recent article from Reuters, the resilience of Chinese chip firms in the face of new US export restrictions is a noteworthy development in the global tech landscape. These companies are asserting their ability to navigate the complexities of international trade and adapt to regulatory challenges.  This situation raises several important questions for industry stakeholders. How will these export curbs reshape the competitive landscape in semiconductor technology? Can Chinese firms innovate independently, or will they find alternative partnerships? The ever-evolving dynamics between the US and China certainly make for an intriguing case study on the intersection of technology, commerce, and geopolitics.  While these firms express confidence, it is crucial to monitor their strategic moves and the broader implications for global supply chains. The semiconductor industry has always been a critical backbone for innovation across sectors, from consumer electronics to automotive tech.  With the challenges posed by export restrictions, we are likely to see increased investments in domestic capabilities and a race for self-reliance among Chinese firms. This shift could potentially alter the landscape of technology development, innovation, and international collaboration.  As professionals in the tech and business sectors, we should keep a close eye on these developments. Engaging with this evolving narrative can foster a deeper understanding of how emerging markets adapt to external pressures and how established players respond.  It‚Äôs also a reminder of the importance of resilience and agility in today‚Äôs fast-paced environment. Whether you're a startup or an industry leader, finding pathways to maintain growth amidst uncertainty is a critical skill.  Stay informed and proactive as these stories unfold.

China has announced an outright ban on the export of a range of materials critical to the production of microchips, thermal imaging cameras, and solar panels to the United States.  Gallium, germanium, antimony, and superhard materials can no longer be exported to America on a general basis, the country‚Äôs Commerce Ministry said. Beijing will also impose stricter end-use controls on dual-use products related to graphite, it added.  The announcement comes after the Biden administration imposed new restrictions on the sale of high-bandwidth memory chips made by US and foreign companies to China, Bloomberg notes.  Last year, President Xi Jinping‚Äôs government placed gallium and germanium under stricter government oversight as tensions between the world‚Äôs largest economies escalated. However, instead of an outright ban, gallium shipments are now subject to licensing.  Gallium chips are widely used in defense and aerospace technology. Germanium is needed for the production of solar panels.  Recall that earlier it became known that the Biden administration before leaving wants to impose additional duties on the import of Chinese solar panels to the United States, and such panels are produced in third countries (where China has managed to move production).

El partido ultraderechista Agrupaci√≥n Nacional, liderado por Marine Le Pen, amenaza con derrocar al gobierno franc√©s mediante una moci√≥n de censura si el primer ministro Michel Barnier no modifica el presupuesto de 2025, incluyendo indexar las pensiones a la inflaci√≥n. El ministro de Econom√≠a, Antoine Armand, rechaz√≥ los ""chantajes"" y ""ultim√°tums,"" mientras que los mercados financieros reaccionaron negativamente: el CAC 40 cay√≥ 1,1% y el euro se debilit√≥ frente al d√≥lar. Esta crisis se suma al contexto pol√≠tico inestable desde que Macron convoc√≥ elecciones anticipadas.   2.       Brasil enfrenta tensiones econ√≥micas con una ca√≠da del 4% en acciones en noviembre, un aumento del d√≥lar de 3,5% y cr√≠ticas a los mercados por parte del ministro Haddad, quien prometi√≥ cumplir con ajustes fiscales y no descarta nuevas medidas. El gobierno busca implementar un impuesto m√≠nimo efectivo, pero enfrenta escepticismo sobre su capacidad de controlar la deuda y el d√©ficit fiscal. Analistas como HSBC y Goldman Sachs advierten sobre la falta de estrategia y proyectan dificultades para reducir la deuda en el corto plazo.   3.       Intel oblig√≥ a su CEO, Pat Gelsinger, a dejar el cargo tras perder la confianza de la junta directiva debido a su lento progreso en recuperar participaci√≥n de mercado y competir en inteligencia artificial frente a Nvidia. Gelsinger, quien implement√≥ una costosa expansi√≥n de f√°bricas respaldada por subsidios del programa Chips Act, no logr√≥ posicionar productos competitivos en un mercado liderado por rivales como TSMC y Samsung. Los co-CEOs interinos, David Zinsner y Michelle Johnston Holthaus, asumir√°n el liderazgo mientras la junta busca un reemplazo.  4.       Las acciones comenzaron diciembre de 2024 alcanzando m√°ximos hist√≥ricos, impulsadas por ganancias en las principales tecnol√≥gicas y expectativas de datos econ√≥micos clave. El S&P 500 acumula un rendimiento anual superior al 25%, su mejor desempe√±o en d√©cadas, y podr√≠a cerrar el mes cerca de 6,300 puntos. Analistas destacan un entorno ""Goldilocks,"" con crecimiento econ√≥mico suficiente para respaldar ganancias, pero d√©bil para justificar posibles recortes de tasas de la Fed.   5.       Bank of America proyecta que el S&P 500 alcanzar√° los 6,666 puntos para finales de 2025, impulsado por un crecimiento econ√≥mico del 2.4% y un desempe√±o liderado por acciones de valor de gran capitalizaci√≥n vinculadas a sectores sensibles al PIB, como Finanzas, Consumo Discrecional, Materiales, Bienes Ra√≠ces y Servicios P√∫blicos.

2024-12-03,Simon Jones BSc MAIG,Life Enthusiast | Earth Scientist | Philosopher | Innovator | Writer,"Blocking China's Rise And The Consequences of Such Policies  Blocking China's rise fuels resentment and animosity, reinforcing the narrative of a zero-sum game where one nation's gain is another's loss resulting in increased geopolitical tensions. These policies may lead to a ""decoupled"" global economy, harming international collaboration and innovation, creating economic fragmentation (such as BRICS - emerging market economy to rival US dollar) and crypto. Stifling another nation‚Äôs growth contradicts the US's ideals like freedom and fairness, raising questions about the ethical implications of such strategies and raises moral questions.  Instead of attempting to halt China's advancement, better alternatives may include fostering fair competition and collaboration which could potentially yield better outcomes. This might involve: ensuring transparency and reciprocity in trade and technology agreements; promoting multilateral agreements that address concerns about intellectual property and fair market access and building a system where innovation, not restriction, drives progress. Given history, and opposing ideologies, this seem unlikely.  The US‚Äôs efforts to contain China‚Äôs rise may reflect a combination of fear, competition, and strategic calculation. While it‚Äôs important to address legitimate concerns, actions perceived as oppressive undermine the very values the US claims to uphold. Empathy and a focus on mutual benefit could pave the way for a less adversarial and more cooperative global future.  The US and China are competing for global economic dominance, leading to economic competition and protectionism such as seen in creating technological advantages through blocking access to the latest TSMC chip technologies and national security concerns.  From a Chinese perspective, these actions can appear oppressive, undermining its legitimate economic growth and innovation. Conversely, the US views it as safeguarding its interests.  The dynamics between countries like the US and China often stem from a combination of economic, geopolitical, and ideological concerns rather than purely oppressive authoritarian control motives.",0.5243,NEGATIVE,0.9984

As reported by Reuters, these measures are aimed at curbing China's access to advanced semiconductors, a critical component for everything from consumer electronics to military equipment.  This development is not just a political maneuver; it has profound implications for global supply chains, innovation, and the competitive landscape of the tech industry. The U.S. government is pushing to maintain its lead in semiconductor technology while limiting China's ability to catch up.  For professionals in the tech and manufacturing sectors, this could signal shifts in partnerships and procurement strategies. Companies may need to reassess their supply chain dependencies and explore alternative sourcing options. Additionally, firms involved in R&D could face delays or increased costs as restrictions limit access to key technologies.  It's essential for businesses to stay informed and agile in response to these changes. Understanding the implications of global trade policies and geopolitical tensions will be crucial for navigating the evolving market landscape.

Now, as the administration approaches a transition, the U.S. has unveiled its toughest and most comprehensive semiconductor export restrictions yet. These new measures aim to severely limit China‚Äôs ability to produce AI chips domestically. Key Aspects of the New Sanctions: Expanded Restrictions: The latest regulations ban Chinese companies from accessing 24 types of chip manufacturing equipment and 3 types of software programs critical to chip production. Foreign Direct Product Rule Adjusted: The 25% threshold for U.S. components in foreign-made chips has been removed. Any system containing U.S. technology, regardless of percentage, is now restricted. Impact on Companies: 140 Chinese firms, including North Huachuang (Naura), Piotech, ACM Research, and SiCarrier Technology, are now blacklisted, requiring special licenses to acquire U.S. software or products. Huawei‚Äôs chip collaborators, like Swaysure and SiEN, are also affected despite recent advancements that rival Western technology. Pressure on Global Suppliers: Companies such as ASML, Canon, and Nikon have been compelled to limit technology exports to China under U.S. influence. Taiwanese chipmaker TSMC has also been directed to halt advanced chip supplies to Chinese clients. Global Ramifications: China‚Äôs Ministry of Commerce has strongly condemned these measures, calling them ""economic coercion"" and ""a violation of global trade rules."" The Ministry asserts that such actions disrupt supply chains and damage international trade stability, adversely affecting not only China but also global semiconductor players, including U.S. firms.  üíª‚öôÔ∏èüåê",0.5376,NEGATIVE,0.9998

He made over-optimistic claims about prospective AI-chip deals that didn‚Äôt materialise, leading to Intel to scrap a recent revenue forecast. From 2021 Gelsinger set hugely ambitious expectations for manufacturing and AI capabilities among major clients. Intel was unable to deliver the promised goods, resulting in lost or cancelled contracts. He focused on reviving Intel's technological dominance through initiatives like the IDM 2.0 strategy and significant investments in U.S.-based chip manufacturing. However, despite progress in advanced nodes and foundry services, Intel lagged in execution and faced financial difficulties, with declining revenue and missed opportunities in AI markets dominated by. Intel‚Äôs stock has lost more than half of its value this year, and it was replaced last month by Nvidia on the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average index (.DJI) Intel‚Äôs future now hinges on maintaining stability under interim leadership while intensifying efforts in AI and semiconductor innovation. For the chip industry, this leadership change might accelerate competition, as Intel strives to close gaps with rivals TSMC and AMD. End customers could benefit from renewed focus on cutting-edge technologies, although short-term uncertainties may delay advancements. The company named Chief Financial Officer David Zinsner and senior executive Michelle Johnston Holthaus as interim co-chief executive officers while its board conducted a search for a new CEO. The moves come less than a week after U.S. officials gave $7.86 billion in subsidies to Intel. Intel‚Äôs transition highlights the broader pressures in semiconductor manufacturing, where geopolitical tensions, rapid technological shifts, and customer demand for AI and computing power drive rapid evolution.

2024-12-03,Abhinav Srivastava,Founders' Office @ Bellatrix Aerospace | Space Tech | ex-DefTech | DeepTech Enthusiast,"Some interesting points from Saanya Ojha on the conundrum that Intel seemingly faces.  Though I think there are some additional aspects to consider here given Pat Gelsinger's departure - though his legacy has been nothing short of legendary.  So, the question is what happened? What went wrong? A bunch of things (within and beyond Pat's control!):  While his efforts to revitalize Intel's manufacturing process through the 5N4Y initiative were noteworthy - but incomplete. To his credit, he recognized the ""death spiral"" the company faced as an IDM with a lagging fab. Catching up to TSMC was always going to be a Herculean task, and his focus there was understandable. However, that focus came at a cost.  The problem was just as much about what Gelsinger didn't do. While pouring energy into manufacturing, he neglected the product side. Intel missed the AI boom, lost data center market share, and failed to articulate a compelling product vision beyond a hopeful ""AI PC super cycle.""  Excellent at manufacturing - perhaps not so much at product.  Now, on to the present: There are recent leadership changes, with Michelle Johnston Holthaus taking the helm of the newly formed ""Intel Products Group"". This dedicated focus on product innovation is long overdue. But Holthaus has her work cut out for her. Can she, with CTO Greg Lavender, truly compete with the likes of Lisa Su and Mark Papermaster at AMD, or Jensen Huang at Nvidia? To be fair her background is in client CPUs ‚Äì a legacy strength, but is it enough in a world that is dominated by AI and accelerated computing?  I think Gelsinger's departure coupled with the existing structure of the ""independent subsidiary inside of Intel"" model for Foundry, makes a complete spin-off increasingly likely.  The recent 8-K filing referencing a hypothetical ""Intel Foundry Corporation"" within the government subsidies agreement suggests that such a move is being seriously considered. This separation would not only address the conflict of interest inherent in Foundry prioritizing its internal customer (Intel Products) but could also unlock value for both entities. It's worth noting that Gelsinger reportedly resisted this level of unbundling, making his departure potentially significant in this regard.  Does Intel come back? I don't know. It could quite quickly just turn into a case of Intel playing the laggard in an industry where product development is at breakneck pace and entities plan out things decades in advance. AMD is the ONLY company I can think of in that segment that has had a phoenix-like rise after stumbling over and over. Not sure if we can see Intel replicate that.  P.S. In case you didn't know: The Intel board has officially unbundled ‚ÄúIntel [the IDM]‚Äù into two divisions: a fabless design group (Products) and a fab (Foundry).

2024-12-03,Chris Schlebusch,"'Where' is a culture, not a subscription.","I would've loved to see some mention of large scale semiconductor manufacturing incentives. In simple terms a TSMC-style fab in Oz. Think of all the world leading skills and trades needed to build it, then operate it, and what the flow-on would be from a long term education planning perspective. That alone would be more valuable than the plant itself, in my opinion. It's as if there is no-one in government that can dream big enough with enough understanding of what it means. World leading coordinated education and high-tech-high-volume-high-margin manufacturing is (too?) complicated. Am I too critical/naive and are there real reasons why this shouldn't be an aspirational goal? It's not a cheap labour thing - don't start with that argument. They got a TSMC fab off the ground in Arizona, Intel runs fabs in Israel, and ASML is Dutch. Why can't we get something like it too? Is it an AUKUS thing?",0.5227,NEGATIVE,0.9865
2024-12-03,Bla≈æej Bucha,Scientific Researcher at Slovak University of Technology,"Spherical harmonic transforms on distributed-memory systems using MPI  In CHarm, spherical harmonic synthesis/analysis of point data can now also be conducted on systems with distributed memory. These could be, for instance, nodes of high-performance computing clusters or a few ordinary PCs interconnected via some network protocol (e.g., SSH). MPI makes it possible to distribute spherical harmonic coefficients and the signal to be analyzed/synthesized among a number of independent shared-memory systems that can communicate together. As a result, it is now fairly possible to perform spherical harmonic transforms up to degrees as high as 100,000 and beyond. This allows us, for instance, to model the Earth's topography at 200-m spatial resolution and higher with .  CHarm now combines three parallelization techniques. Within a single CPU, CHarm takes advantage of CPU instructions (AVX, AVX2, AVX-512, NEON). On shared-memory systems (e.g., multicore CPUs), the parallelization is done by . Finally, on distributed-memory systems (e.g., HPC clusters), parallelization is now supported.  CHarm is a C/Python library for high-degree spherical harmonic transforms mainly focused on (but not limited to) modelling.  Source code: Documentation: Cookbook-style examples: New benchmarks (no MPI):  In case you too enjoy talking about spherical harmonics, meet me at my poster G33B-3381 at in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, 11 December 2024.

2024-12-03,KST Components Limited,"1,390 followers","In the third quarter of 2024, global foundry industry revenue increased by 27% year-on-year and 11% quarter-on-quarter. TSMC has a market share of 64%.  TSMC's third quarter performance in 2024 was strong, with strong gross margins exceeding expectations. This success was mainly due to the high utilization of its cutting-edge nodes, including N5 and N3, which benefited from the demand for AI accelerators and the strong seasonality of smartphones. The company expanded its industry revenue share to 64% in the third quarter from 62% in the previous quarter. TSMC expects AI-related demand to grow significantly in the next few years, and AI servers already account for a dozen of its revenue in 2024. The company expects this AI revenue share to grow further in the future as cloud service providers continue to adopt more and practical AI applications emerge. Although the company has announced that it will at least double its CoWoS capacity in 2025, it is still not enough to meet customers' strong demand for AI. In the non-AI semiconductor market, despite continued weak demand, TSMC expects a steady recovery from 2025, alleviating concerns that the semiconductor cycle may have peaked.  Samsung Foundry's revenue increased slightly quarter-on-quarter, mainly due to weaker-than-expected seasonal demand for Android smartphones. However, the company still maintained its second position with a 12% market share in the third quarter of 2024. Samsung Foundry is advancing its 2nm GAA process with the goal of achieving mass production by 2025, focusing on optimizing performance, power and area (PPA) for mobile, HPC, AI and automotive applications. The company is also working with customers to develop advanced 2.5D and 3D packaging solutions to ensure the competitiveness of its 2nm platform through continuous innovation.  SMIC's third quarter 2024 results were strong, with the company reporting strong revenue growth driven by recovering demand for consumer electronics, smartphones and IoT applications. The company's 12-inch wafer shipments increased significantly thanks to an improved product mix and higher average selling prices. SMIC's overall utilization rate rose to 90.4%, reflecting continued strong demand, especially at 28nm, 40nm and 65nm nodes. Although fourth-quarter guidance remains conservative due to expected seasonal weakness, the company remains optimistic about its annual growth prospects, thanks to its focus on leveraging domestic demand and localization efforts.",0.5856,POSITIVE,0.544

2024-12-03,Kakuba Gerald,Hardware Design Engineer at Silicon Mechanics,"I strongly assure everyone reading this that any country accepting the U.S.'s propaganda to restrict its companies from shipping products to Chinese firms will regret it within 15 years.  This strategy mirrors the historical ""divide and rule"" tactic used in Africa. The U.S. aims to consolidate global manufacturing within its territory. Once that goal is achieved, it will impose unfavorable tariffs or push foreign companies out entirely.  By then, these countries will lack viable alternatives. The U.S. will have become significantly stronger, overtaking them in areas where they once excelled. These nations will lose their leverage in negotiations, effectively surrendering their autonomy.  The U.S. strategy is clear: attract companies with cutting-edge technology, like TSMC, ASML, Samsung, and others, to establish branches in the U.S. Over time, these companies will be compelled to prioritize investment and R&D in their U.S.-based campuses. Eventually, their home branches, once proud headquarters, will become mere shadows of their former selves‚Äîinferior to their U.S. counterparts.  When this happens, these nations‚ÄîJapan, the Netherlands, South Korea, the UK, and others‚Äîwill lose their place at the global negotiating table. They will realize, too late, that they were used as pawns.  My advice to countries with technological assets that the U.S. relies on:  Recognize that these technologies are your leverage, your gold‚Äîprotect them fiercely.  Avoid taking sides. Stay neutral and maintain your autonomy.  Continue supplying products to all markets, resisting pressure to align with the U.S.'s sanction schemes.   Short-term alignment with the U.S. might seem strategically sound now because their companies are still catching up. However, once the U.S. firms gain dominance, the alliance will lose its value, leaving partner nations at a severe disadvantage.

Just like in politics, it is hard to take charge of a big company after previous years of mismanagement. So, no matter how easy it would be to point out his failures with the last three generations of Intel's CPUs and the too-slow rollout of Intel's dedicated GPUs in the face of much faster-moving competition from AMD and Nvidia, let's focus on what he managed to do right.  Intel is currently the only company capable of chip manufacturing that has the ASML machines able to produce chips at sub-3nm scale in their most recent chip factories on U.S. soil. Yes, TSMC will apparently soon receive them as well, but the head start Intel managed to get in constructing new chip fabs under Gelsinger's leadership has the potential to bring advanced chip production back to the West, which may prove to be very crucial in the current difficult geopolitical climate.  Intel's dedicated GPUs mentioned above may have had a slow rollout and took much longer than originally planned, but this was a step in the right direction. The more competition we have in this very difficult field, the better it is for the whole market. Both end customers, aka gamers, and companies running large AI data centers will eventually benefit from having multiple options when it comes to hardware.

But Lu Xingzhi, a well-known semiconductor analyst, believes that the focus now is who the board of directors should find to take over Intel?

Since taking over as CEO of Intel in 2021, Kissinger has proposed a four-year revitalization plan in an attempt to reverse the predicament, but the strategy has not worked. During his tenure, Intel's market value has shrunk significantly and is now only one-thirtieth of Nvidia, which focuses on artificial intelligence chips.  According to Reuters, people familiar with the matter revealed that at last week's Intel board meeting, it was felt that Jissinger's costly transformation plan was progressing slowly and was ineffective, so he was asked to choose ""retirement"" or ""dismissal."" Ge finally chose to retire.  Semiconductor analyst Lu Xingzhi analyzed on Facebook that Ji Xingji originally signed a contract for five years, but ended up packing up and leaving after three years. Was it because the board of directors forced him to retire early before his term was completed? Or are you disappointed and leaving your job because you are trapped in a tight trap that cannot be 100% divided and create cancer? He believes that Kissinji has been not favored not long after taking office, waiting to see when he will be ""let go"" (fired).  Lu Xingzhi further pointed out the contradictory strategies proposed by Ji Xingji, such as finding TSMC to manufacture advanced manufacturing processes, but saying all day long that Taiwan's geopolitics is dangerous; he also vigorously developed wafer foundry and expanded production everywhere to obtain subsidies, which resulted in Intel's collapse. The losses are getting bigger and bigger, and they are out of control.  Lu Xingzhi even mentioned that Ji Xingji set an unachievable goal of five nodes in four years.

2024-12-03,"Sinan Othman, Ph.D.",Product Management & Business Development Leader,"Intel Corp. Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger was forced out after the board lost confidence in his plans to turn around the iconic chipmaker, adding to turmoil at one of the pioneers of the technology industry.  The clash came to a head last week when Gelsinger met with the board about the company‚Äôs progress on winning back market share and narrowing the gap with Nvidia Corp., according to people familiar with the matter. He was given the option to retire or be removed, and chose to announce the end of his career at Intel, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the proceedings weren‚Äôt made public.  Intel Chief Financial Officer David Zinsner and Executive Vice President Michelle Johnston Holthaus are serving as interim co-CEOs while the board searches for Gelsinger‚Äôs replacement, the company said in a statement. Frank Yeary, independent chair of the board of Intel, will serve as interim executive chair.  Gelsinger, 63, was once hailed as a savior of the chip giant. After taking the reins three years ago, he professed his love for the company and said he was determined to restore it to preeminence in the semiconductor industry. The executive first began working at Intel when he was a teenager but left in 2009 and became CEO of VMware Inc. Upon returning in 2021, he promised to regain the chipmaker‚Äôs lead in manufacturing ‚Äî something it had lost to rivals like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.  Gelsinger couldn‚Äôt immediately be reached for comment.  Intel investors, eager to see changes at the company, applauded the CEO‚Äôs departure. The shares gained as much as 6% in New York on Monday, though they remain down about 50% this year.  Gelsinger set out to take Intel beyond its traditional strength in personal computer and server processors by expanding into making chips for other companies ‚Äî something it had never done before and putting it into direct competition with TSMC and Samsung Electronics Co. As part of his revival strategy, Gelsinger laid out a costly plan to expand Intel‚Äôs factory network. That included building a massive new complex in Ohio, a project for which the company received federal aid from the Chips and Science Act.  Whoever replaces Gelsinger will face the same set of problems he was brought in to fix, including the fallout from poor decisions made by his predecessors. What would have once been the most desirable job in the $500 billion chip industry has become a nearly untenable position. The next CEO has to take on competitors with greater resources and catch up in AI computing, all while showing that Intel can be the groundbreaking company it once was.  Finding someone to take that hot seat may not be easy. Before Gelsinger was appointed to replace CEO Bob Swan, there was speculation that a number of prominent executives were possible candidates. Many on Wall Street proposed approaching Advanced Micro Devices Inc.‚Äôs Lisa Su for the job. [...]",0.5504,NEGATIVE,0.9965

2024-12-03,Armand Jacobs,üîß Business Manager / Manager Engineering: VIRO Echt B.V.,"Intel CEO Gelsinger moet opstappen Bestuur verloor vertrouwen in turnaround plan  Saemvatting - Gelsinger vertrekt voordat Intel's turnaround-plan is voltooid - De aandelen van Intel dalen met 0,5%; Het is dit jaar met de helft gedaald - Communicatiechef is van plan het bedrijf te verlaten, zeggen bronnen - Zinsner en Holthaus benoemd tot interim co-CEO's tijdens CEO-zoektocht - CEO was begonnen met een turnaround-plan van ontslagen, verkoop van activa  Intel Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger is gedwongen te vertrekken minder dan vier jaar nadat hij het roer van het bedrijf heeft overgenomen en de controle heeft overgedragen aan twee luitenants terwijl het haperende Amerikaanse chipmaking-icoon op zoek is naar een permanente vervanger. Gelsinger, die op 1 december ontslag nam, vertrok na een bestuursvergadering vorige week waarin directeuren vonden dat het kostbare en ambitieuze plan van Gelsinger om Intel om te draaien niet werkte en dat de voortgang van de verandering niet snel genoeg was, volgens een persoon die bekend is met de zaak. Het bestuur vertelde Gelsinger dat hij met pensioen kon gaan of verwijderd kon worden, en hij koos ervoor om af te treden, aldus de bron.  Zijn vertrek komt ruim voor de voltooiing van zijn vierjarige routekaart om de voorsprong van het bedrijf in het maken van de snelste en kleinste computerchips te herstellen, een kroon die het verloor aan TSMC, die chips maakt voor Intel-rivalen zoals Nvidia. Onder Gelsinger is Intel, dat in 1968 werd opgericht en decennialang de basis vormde van de wereldwijde dominantie van Silicon Valley op het gebied van chips, verschrompeld tot een marktwaarde die meer dan 30 keer kleiner is dan Nvidia, de leider op het gebied van kunstmatige-intelligentiechips.  Gelsinger erfde in 2021 een bedrijf vol uitdagingen die hij verergerde. Intel stelde hoge ambities voor productie- en AI-capaciteiten bij grote klanten, maar verloor of annuleerde uiteindelijk contracten onder zijn toezicht en was niet in staat om de beloofde goederen te leveren, volgens een speciaal rapport van Reuters in oktober. Hij deed optimistische beweringen over toekomstige AI-chipdeals die Intels eigen schattingen overtroffen, waardoor het bedrijf ongeveer een maand geleden een recente omzetprognose schrapte.  Bloomberg berichtte eerder over de omstandigheden rond de pensionering van Gelsinger. Gelsinger, 63, heeft zowel investeerders als Amerikaanse functionarissen, die de ommekeer van Intel subsidi√´ren, verzekerd dat zijn productieplannen op schema blijven. Maar de volledige resultaten zullen pas volgend jaar bekend zijn, wanneer het bedrijf ernaar streeft een vlaggenschip-laptopchip terug in zijn eigen fabrieken te brengen.",0.5074,POSITIVE,0.9969

Example: TSMC's new fab in Arizona is estimated to cost over $40 billion.  The extreme precision required in semiconductor manufacturing necessitates cleanroom environments and specialized equipment, significantly driving up costs.  üöÄ Semiconductor fabrication plant (fab)  Moore's Law, which states that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles approximately every two years, 1 continues to drive rapid innovation.  Example: The transition from 7nm to 5nm and now 3nm process nodes requires significant R&D investments and technological breakthroughs.  The relentless pace of technological advancement forces chipmakers to constantly invest in research and development to stay competitive.  üöÄ Complex Manufacturing Process:  Semiconductor manufacturing involves hundreds of steps, each with a low margin of error.  Example: Photolithography, a critical step in chipmaking, requires precise alignment of masks to create intricate circuit patterns.  The intricate and delicate nature of the manufacturing process necessitates highly skilled workers, advanced equipment, and stringent quality control measures.  üöÄ Semiconductor manufacturing process  Semiconductor chips are manufactured in a global supply chain involving multiple countries and regions.  Example: A single chip may involve components sourced from the US, Europe, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan.  The complex and interconnected nature of the global supply chain makes it vulnerable to geopolitical tensions, trade disputes, and natural disasters, which can disrupt production and increase costs.  üöÄ Highly Skilled Workforce:  Semiconductor engineers and technicians require years of specialized training and education.  Example: A semiconductor engineer may need a PhD in electrical engineering or materials science.  The demand for highly skilled workers in the semiconductor industry often exceeds supply, making it challenging to attract and retain top talent.

On November 7, TSMC was fined $16,131, an important warning for the Asian company to adapt to U.S. safety regulations. At the same time, is also facing a lawsuit over alleged discrimination against Asians in the hiring process. These incidents have not only raised questions about TSMC's success in transplanting its local management culture, but also reflected the difficulties of the company's cross-cultural operations. However, the U.S. Department of Commerce remains confident in TSMC's ability to adapt, approving $6.6 billion in subsidies under the Act and plans to release at least $1 billion in 2024.

Various local investment advisors have also released their outlooks for Taiwan stocks in 2025 at the end of this month, and most of them are optimistic that Taiwan stocks will challenge new highs next year, with Monte Jade and CITIC giving the highest high of 27,500 points.  Regarding the outlook for 2025, all the investment advisors believe that the profits of Taiwan's listed companies and Taiwan's GDP are expected to continue to grow, which is expected to further boost the weighted index, and each advisor predicts that Taiwan stocks will reach a high of 25,000 to 27,500 points next year. However, it is still necessary to pay attention to the policies introduced by Donald Trump after his inauguration, which may affect the stock market due to political and economic uncertainties. If there is a pullback, the lows predicted by various investment advisors are around 20,000~21,500 points, and there will be a strong support near the annual line, which is considered by the advisors to be a good opportunity to lay out the market on the low side.

2024-12-03,ANNY Y.,Semiconductor Distributor | Workwear Supplier | Startupper | Runner,"hashtag #Intel's board gave CEO Pat Gelsinger the option to retire or be removed due to concerns over the progress of his ambitious turnaround plan, which sought to restore the company to its former leadership in the industry. Despite Gelsinger's efforts to reinvigorate Intel with large investments in manufacturing and technology, the company struggled with delays in its chip production timeline, losing ground to competitors like TSMC and AMD. These challenges, combined with the growing pressure from investors for faster results and improved financial performance, led the board to reassess Gelsinger‚Äôs leadership. His plan, though bold, faced significant execution hurdles, and ultimately, Intel's board needed to determine whether a change in leadership would better position the company for future success.  Intel‚Äôs recent self-rescue efforts over the past few months can be distilled into three key strategies: -Burden reduction  -External assistance -Pie-in-the-sky ambitions  Despite these efforts, Intel‚Äôs self-rescue measures have been met with mixed results. The foundry business is still far from turning around, and the company's competitive position in the semiconductor market remains fragile. Intel‚Äôs delays in advancing its process nodes, especially compared to TSMC, are worrying. The new Arizona wafer factory, which was supposed to come online in 2025, is also facing delays, further complicating Intel‚Äôs ability to meet its 18A goals. Moreover, Intel‚Äôs product performance has been underwhelming, with its new Core Ultra 200 series processors failing to generate the expected market excitement.  Intel‚Äôs efforts to capitalize on the AI boom have not yet paid off either. Despite Gelsinger's optimism about Intel‚Äôs AI roadmap, market realities tell a different story. The company‚Äôs Gaudi chips, which were touted as a major growth driver, have underperformed. Sales expectations for the Gaudi series have been slashed, and shipments of the upcoming Gaudi 3 chip are expected to be reduced by at least 30% in 2025.  Intel‚Äôs road to recovery remains long and uncertain. The company‚Äôs ambitious plans, from the 18A process to AI-driven products, are still in their infancy, and the challenges they face in execution are significant. While Intel has made progress in reducing costs and seeking external help, it remains to be seen whether these measures will be enough to restore the company to its former glory. The real test will come when the 18A process is put into mass production and when Intel‚Äôs AI products are tested in the marketplace. For now, investors and industry watchers are holding their breath, hoping that Intel can turn things around‚Äîbut the road ahead is anything but clear.

2024-12-03,Erudite Asia,"1,278 followers","Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Ltd.'s stock market is weak after falling. Xie Jinhe: Semiconductors have reached a critical moment  TSMC's stock price is struggling, recently trading around 1,000 yuan after a drop to 992 yuan. Xie Jinhe, chairman of Xinhua Media, links this decline to former President Trump's claims about American technology theft, contributing to the broader downturn in the Taiwan stock market. He identifies three main challenges for TSMC and the Taiwanese semiconductor sector: Trump's statements, competitive pressures from China's mature processes, and a decline in demand from China.  In November, TSMC's stock fell by 44 yuan, from 1,090 to 992 yuan. Xie emphasized that the semiconductor industry is at a critical juncture, with Taiwanese companies facing not just fundamental issues but also uncertainties from Trump's variable stance and competition from China. Other firms like UMC and AMD are already feeling the pressure, with UMC's stock dropping by 9.55% in November.  Xie warns that losing the edge in mature processes would significantly impact TSMC, which is already seeing price reductions in its mature process products. The previously high demand from China has diminished, leading to a decline in stock prices for global semiconductor equipment manufacturers, including ASML and Applied Materials.

Esta estrategia se basa en tres pilares fundamentales:  1. Red interna de fabricaci√≥n global: Intel contin√∫a fabricando la mayor√≠a de sus productos internamente, aprovechando su red de f√°bricas para optimizar productos, mejorar la econom√≠a y garantizar la resiliencia en la cadena de suministro.   2. Colaboraci√≥n con fabricantes externos: La empresa ha incrementado el uso de capacidad de fundici√≥n de terceros para ciertos productos, lo que le proporciona flexibilidad y escalabilidad en su producci√≥n.   3. Servicios de manufactura de Intel (Intel Foundry Services): Intel ha establecido una unidad de negocio independiente para ofrecer servicios de fabricaci√≥n a terceros, con el objetivo de convertirse en un proveedor clave de capacidad de manufactura en Estados Unidos y Europa.    Esta estrategia busca fortalecer la posici√≥n de Intel en la industria de semiconductores, permiti√©ndole competir m√°s eficazmente con l√≠deres del sector como TSMC. Sin embargo, la implementaci√≥n de IDM 2.0 ha enfrentado desaf√≠os financieros y operativos. En agosto de 2024, se inform√≥ que Intel estaba luchando por igualar la capacidad de producci√≥n de chips de √∫ltima generaci√≥n de TSMC, enfrentando dificultades financieras que podr√≠an obligarla a reconsiderar su estrategia.  A pesar de estos obst√°culos, Intel ha continuado avanzando en su hoja de ruta tecnol√≥gica. En octubre de 2024, la compa√±√≠a lanz√≥ la familia de procesadores Intel Core Ultra 200S, conocida como ""Arrow Lake"", que incorpora inteligencia artificial para mejorar la experiencia de gaming.  En resumen, la estrategia IDM 2.0 de Intel representa un esfuerzo integral para revitalizar su liderazgo en la industria de semiconductores, combinando fabricaci√≥n interna, colaboraci√≥n con terceros y la oferta de servicios de manufactura a clientes externos. Aunque ha enfrentado desaf√≠os en su implementaci√≥n, la compa√±√≠a contin√∫a innovando y adapt√°ndose a las demandas del mercado.",0.5064,POSITIVE,0.9954

2024-12-03,Deep Majumdar,"Journalist, Video Producer, Consumer Tech","Patrick Gelsinger is out! What's Next for the US chip company?   Full story on>>  üíª Intel's CEO finally departs after a 30-plus year run and a 3-plus year stint as CEO.  üíª Gelsinger was given the option to step down or be removed after the board lost confidence in his plans to turn around the American chipmaking icon, Bloomberg reported.  üíª, Chief Financial Officer and, EVP, Client Computing will take up the mantle of interim co-chief executives following Gelsinger‚Äôs retirement, Intel stated in a press release. Frank Yeary, independent chair of the board of Intel will serve as Interim Executive Chair.  üíª Intel‚Äôs Foundry Dilemma And Its AI Woes  Artificial intelligence computing is a sector that cost Intel billions in revenue. This money that could have gone to Intel‚Äôs data centre business was instead taken by Nvidia which turned its GPUs into essential components of AI computing.  üíª Gelsinger‚Äôs plan to explore avenues beyond personal computing and server processors such as making chips for other companies, a.k.a., its foundry business was unprecedented.  üíª While companies like Qualcomm and MediaTek chose to outsource their chip needs, Intel looked inward. It put the American tech giant in a head-to-head battle with companies like Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC).  üíª The Intel Foundry has been on a promising growth curve and roadmap but it needed a ""big reset"" in terms of leadership. With Gelsinger gone, the new CEO needs to approach AI chip innovation more aggressively.  üíª Arm Wrestling: Is Intel Losing?  The uprising of Arm-based processors is not a new story. Arm chips have been in the play for quite some time now. Cut to 2024 and we have all of the major OEMs in personal computing implementing Arm chips in their notebooks. Leading this list is Apple Silicon followed by Qualcomm‚Äôs Snapdragon X Elite.  üíª Currently, while Arm-based PCs control about 18 per cent of the notebook market, this number is projected to reach 40 per cent by 2025 as more Windows on Arm AI PCs are available. Meanwhile, Intel commands over 70 per cent of the x86 notebook market which is slowly slipping away.  üíª What‚Äôs Next For Intel: 18A To The Rescue?  Intel is banking heavily on the 18A to attract customers and boost revenue. Not that it already isn‚Äôt contributing to Intel‚Äôs growth. Intel has already gotten contracts from the US Department of Defense, Boeing, AWS and Microsoft. Plus, a push for AI chip innovation and advanced chip packaging will be key.  Intel's future success in AI will depend on whether its new CEO takes a more aggressive approach to AI innovations.  ‚úç Insights from||||  |||",0.5506,NEGATIVE,0.9673

However, rather than waiting passively, Intel is proactively strengthening its leadership bench by adding two seasoned executives to its board of directors: Eric Meurice, the former CEO of ASML, and Steve Sanghi, the interim CEO of Microchip Technology.  Both new board members bring an immense wealth of semiconductor manufacturing experience, which Intel needs as it continues to navigate the rapidly evolving tech landscape. Meurice's expertise from ASML, a company central to the production of cutting-edge semiconductor equipment, and Sanghi‚Äôs leadership in microchip technology at Microchip Technology will offer Intel critical insights as it drives forward innovation in semiconductor design and manufacturing.  This strategic shift is a strong signal that Intel is not only focused on finding a new CEO but is also committed to reinforcing its leadership in the semiconductor space. With Intel‚Äôs ambition to lead in advanced chip technology, having executives with deep operational experience in this sector is vital. In a broader context, this move is a reminder of the importance of resilient leadership in times of transition.  Similarly, in Canada, companies in the tech and manufacturing sectors are also recognizing the value of enhancing leadership diversity and expertise to navigate technological advancements. Companies like and have increasingly turned to seasoned professionals from the tech industry to fill critical roles, ensuring they stay ahead in an ever-changing market.  This shift in Intel‚Äôs leadership could well set a precedent for how major corporations in North America address leadership transitions. As businesses face new challenges whether in technology, supply chains, or global competition, the ability to rapidly adjust leadership to meet these challenges is becoming a critical success factor.

The author thinks that Intel shoudl focus on IFS and not on X86 architecture. While only China could build up a Foundry competing with TSMC, the time has passed for the US and UE.  Intel's Board of Directors: A Catalyst for Decline  This paper provides a comprehensive examination of Intel's leadership issues, strategic missteps, and eroding market position.  ‚Ä¢ Board incompetence: 7 of 11 members lack relevant semiconductor experience ‚Ä¢ Cultural shift: From engineering focus to business-oriented management ‚Ä¢ Process technology failures: 10nm node debacle allowed competitors to gain market share ‚Ä¢ Erosion of x86 dominance: Rise of Arm-based processors in client and server markets  The authors trace Intel's problems to the appointment of Paul Otellini as CEO, marking a shift from technical leadership to business-oriented management. This change led to a cultural transformation that prioritized political power over technical excellence.  Intel's failure in developing its 10nm process node is identified as a critical turning point, enabling competitors like TSMC and AMD to gain significant market share. The paper also discusses the erosion of Intel's x86 moat in both client and server markets, with Arm-based processors and accelerated computing solutions posing significant threats.  The analysis extends to Intel's financial decisions, criticizing the focus on stock buybacks over capital expenditures during Bob Swan's tenure as CEO. This approach is described as malpractice in a capital-intensive industry when the company was losing market share and lagging in process technology.  The paper argues that Intel's board has made a series of poor decisions, culminating in the dismissal of Pat Gelsinger and a renewed focus on x86 products. The authors contend that this strategy is misguided and unlikely to address Intel's fundamental challenges.  Limitations of the study include potential bias in assessing board decisions and a focus on internal factors without fully exploring external market dynamics. The analysis may also underestimate the challenges faced by Arm-based processors in fully displacing x86 in certain markets.  This comprehensive analysis provides valuable insights into the challenges faced by established technology companies in maintaining market leadership and the critical role of board decisions in shaping a company's trajectory.",0.548,NEGATIVE,0.998

It explains why TSMC was right to push the FF until 3nm and not to move to GAA too early like SEC has done.  The research uses 3D numerical simulations to analyze and compare the performance of PFFETs and GAAFETs for high-performance (HP) and low-operation-power (LOP) applications. Results show comparable integration densities based on 6T-SRAM cell layouts for both device types.  For HP applications, PFFETs and GAAFETs demonstrate similar drive currents and intrinsic delays. In LOP scenarios, GAAFETs initially outperform PFFETs, but optimizing the PFFET's effective channel length can enhance its competitiveness.

The US-China trade war, technological disputes, supply chain restructuring, and COVID-19-related travel restrictions caused a drop in overseas employment, reaching a low of 319,000 in 2021. As the pandemic's impact waned, the number of Taiwanese working overseas rebounded in 2022 and 2023. It reached 621,000 in 2023, a year-on-year increase of 148,000, although still below pre-pandemic levels. While China remained the leading destination with 217,000 Taiwanese workers in 2023, its share dropped to 35%, down from 62.2% in 2011. This was due to factors like rising production costs and the return of Taiwanese businesses, Tan said.",0.561,NEGATIVE,0.543

2024-12-14,Boluwatife Adekola,Attended Obafemi Awolowo University,"Today we will be exploring a vital concept abbreviated PDKs meaning,PROCESS DESIGN KITS.... Hmm where do we go from here?ü§îüòÉ  Alright,now imagine you want to design a microchip. To do that, you need a guide to make sure your design can actually be built by a semiconductor factory (foundry). A Process Design Kit (PDK) is that guide.  A Process Design Kit (PDK) is like a guide for designing microchips. It includes design rules, models for how components behave electrically, and tools to check if a design can be made into a real chip. It helps ensure that the design will be manufacturable.  For the process node (like 5nm or 7nm),it refers to the size of the features on the chip. Smaller nodes allow more transistors, improving performance and power efficiency. However, each semiconductor company (e.g., TSMC, Intel, Samsung) has its own way of making chips, even for the same node size. This means that each company provides a different PDK, customized to their specific technology, materials, and performance goals. For example, one company may focus on mobile devices while another targets high-performance computing.  The rise of open access PDKs is changing the game. These are free and available to anyone, which allows smaller companies, universities, and even hobbyists to design chips without high costs. A good example is the Google-SkyWater 130nm PDK, which opened chip design to the public. This has made chip design more accessible and encouraged innovation by letting more people experiment with and create their own chips.  In short, PDKs are essential for chip design, and open access PDKs are making it easier and cheaper for a wider range of people to get involved in semiconductor development.  What do you think about PDKs? Let's meet at the comment section üëá",0.534,POSITIVE,0.997
