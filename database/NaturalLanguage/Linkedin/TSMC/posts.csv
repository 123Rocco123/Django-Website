2024-12-03,Deepak gupta,Technical Author at TechShali,"Through a simple press release, Intel has announced that Pat GelsingerCEO of the company for the last three years and who arrived to “save it at a bad time”, is no longer the top leader. The curious thing about this is that no one seems to be clear if it is Intel who has terminated Gelsinger, if they have “invited him to retire” or if it was he himself who has resigned, but the fact is that the future of the company is now more uncertain than ever.   With the “exit” of Pat Gelsinger, the company has released a press release announcing that the company’s leadership has also been temporarily restructured, and has named two temporary co-CEOs: David Zinsner (as executive vice president and chief financial officer (CFO)) and Michelle Johnston Holthaus (as CEO of the newly created “Intel Products” division). Intel without Pat Gelsinger, more lost than ever Not even a month ago, Intel declared the largest losses ever recorded by the company: $16.6 billion. After this disaster, the company decided to “lighten up” and laid off 15,000 employees while making several adjustments to try to mitigate these financial problems, making it clear that, of course, things were not going well for them.   But things weren’t going very well before either, and in fact Pat Gelsinger came to Intel a little over three years ago to try to revive a company that was failing… although it seems that, in the end, things haven’t gone as expected. seen what has been seen. Of course, in the press release, the company has not attributed the departure of its CEO to any of these reasons. In fact, before Pat Gelsinger left he did leave some guidelines to “save” the company in 2025, such as simplifying the product catalog, improving organizational efficiency and focusing on the development of its Intel 18A node. The plan that Gelsinger presented when he was promoted as the company’s top executive seemed quite good, and a good future was predicted; But of course, that’s what they always say when they name a new CEO. Now we will see if the company’s new co-CEOs decide to follow in the wake that Gelsinger has left or not, but what is clear is that after his more than 40 years in the company, it is not that his 3 years as CEO are going to make a difference. no milestone… at least not positive. The AI train, the main culprit? It is clear that Intel has missed the AI train and it is going to be very difficult for them to catch it again, especially given the advantage that other competing companies are taking from them, and this is a very important point because… well , because you know, it’s the trendy topic, right? Everyone knows that NVIDIA has taken the lead in this area (with permission from TSMC, who got involved even before), and although we all expected that a company with the importance, budget and renown of Intel would immediately take behind, in reality it was not like that.  Arriving late to this demanded market has been",0.5576,NEGATIVE,1.0
2024-12-03,Puneet Singh,"VP, Engineering, MemryX","Pat's departure from Intel has left many of us wondering about the reasons. While we can speculate on the reason, we can all agree that the latest disruption for Intel was its lag/miss on AI. This wasn't due to lack of investment (Habana, Nervana, Granulate) or inhouse foundational capability in Datacenter/GPU - so what was amiss?  AI disrupts the traditional compute workload, its critical for companies to ensure the HW/SW design truly works best for this new workload and seamlessly integrates into the AI ECO system - choice of the HW architecture and the accompanying SW stack defines adoption and success thereby.  Lessons we can learn from Intel's previous misstep in mobile - the Fab ecosystem grew stronger than Intel's as market competition, investment and innovation provided the winds behind TSMC's sails. Great technology misaligned with the ecosystem cannot flourish.  We're still in early stages of AI with cloud vs edge, training vs inferencing, and customization for different types of AI workloads/models yet to shape their market. History is proof that technology always evolves and companies sometimes reinvent themselves to come back much stronger.

2024-12-03,Emilia Guérin,--,"TSMC engineers say 2nm yield rate increased by 6%, saving customers billions of dollars  [Financial Channel/Comprehensive Report] TSMC is expected to start using the N2 (2nm level) process in the second half of next year. The team has successfully increased the yield rate of test chips by 6%, which can ""create billions of dollars for the company's customers"" cost savings”.  Tomshardware reported that a TSMC employee who called himself Dr. Kim did not disclose whether the foundry has improved the yield of SRAM test wafers or logic test wafers. TSMC will only begin providing shuttle test wafer services for 2nm technology in January next year, and is unlikely to increase the production of actual chip prototypes that will eventually be manufactured with 2nm. Improving the yield of SRAM and logic test wafers is really important because ultimately it saves customers a lot of costs and thus benefits from higher yields.  TSMC's N2 will be the company's first to use gate-all-around (GAA) nanosheet transistors, which are expected to significantly reduce power consumption and increase performance and transistor density. In particular, TSMC's GAA nanosheet transistors are not only smaller than 3nm FinFET transistors, but also enable smaller, high-density SRAM bit cells by providing improved static control and reduced leakage without affecting performance.  Wafers manufactured using N2 manufacturing technology are expected to consume between 25% and 30% less power than wafers manufactured using N3E at the same transistor count and frequency, and provide 10% to 15% less power at the same transistor count and power. % performance improvement and a 15% increase in transistor density compared to N3E-made semiconductors while maintaining the same speed and power.  In early May this year, when TSMC’s 2024 Technology Forum was held in Taiwan, Zhang Xiaoqiang, senior vice president of business development and deputy co-chief operating officer, said that the 2-nanometer process using innovative nanosheets (Nanosheet) was progressing “very smoothly”. At present, nanometer The chip conversion performance has reached the target of 90%, and the conversion yield exceeds 80%.

The semiconductor is divided into two types: intrinsic and extrinsic semiconductors. _________________________________________ Why do we need extrinsic semiconductors?  The major purpose of extrinsic semiconductors is to better the conductivity of a semiconductor material, this is done by carrying out doping i.e. adding a small amount of impurity to a pure semiconductor.   What is doping 🤔?  What doping really does is to alter the electrical properties of the semiconductor by introducing an impurity atom into its crystal lattice, this impurities modifies the number of free charge carriers(electron or holes), thereby increasing the ability of the materials to conduct electricity.  _________________________________________  Compound semiconductors???

2024-12-03,Mukesh Kishore Sahay,Engineer R&D,"📶  hashtag #Smartwatch  hashtag #Speakers Slim Down With  hashtag #Silicon /  hashtag #xMEMS’ latest  hashtag #microspeaker extends beyond in-ear applications     ▪️A year after introducing the first in-ear, silicon-based earbuds, xMEMS has unveiled a prototype of the latest version of its microspeakers—this time, for use as an open-air speaker, which is a more challenging task.  ▪️The Silicon Valley-based startup’s previous microspeakers brought ( ) to and boasted excellent sound quality. By modulating , the speakers create high-fidelity sound in a light and compact device. The clarity of sound that the new silicon-and- , , produces is more like that of a smartphone speaker—decent, but far from the sound quality of in-ear alternatives. And like a smartphone speaker, Sycamore is intended for open-air audio produced by devices near or on the body. In particular, the speaker could be used in various wearable devices, like smart watches, XR glasses, or open earbuds, which clip around the ear instead of nestling within it.  ▪️For these applications, the advantage of using MEMS drivers instead of a conventional speaker is less about sound quality, and more about size. The microspeaker is about 1 thick, one-third the thickness of a coil driver, and removing the magnetic coils of conventional speakers brings its weight down by roughly 70 percent to 150 milligrams. Other speakers also require empty space behind the diaphragm, called back volume. The MEMS-based speakers significantly reduce the back volume needed.  ▪️For wearables, every millimeter and milligram matters; a heavy or bulky design could deter users, says Mike Housholder, xMEMS’ vice president of marketing and business development. That’s why the microspeakers are “perfect for smart watches.” Users seeking excellent audio quality would likely opt for in-ear buds or over-ear headphones. The thin, open-air microspeakers instead help deliver a sleek, “fashion-forward” product, Housholder says.

2024-12-03,Yoke Hor Phua,More than 300mm wafer size Initiator/Creator in Advanced Fanout Packaging.Head of Equipment,"Advanced Packaging and Chiplets Can Be for Everyone.  The chiplet revolution is upon us. What began in laboratories as multi-die science projects has eventually evolved. A giant company like AMD, Intel or Nvidia can produce—either at TSMC or, in Intel’s case, internally—a giant, startlingly expensive CPU or GPU multi-die assembly using advanced packaging to achieve remarkable density, power efficiency and performance.  However, the real promise of chiplets is something different: to democratize the design of complex silicon systems so that even systems developers and small-fabless semiconductor companies could develop them.    I believe the next generation of industry leaders will be those companies capable of designing and integrating complex, system-level chip solutions, leveraging concepts like advanced packaging. Merely making individual components will rapidly lose luster, replaced by collaborative efforts that bring together the best in design, packaging and system integration to meet the market’s demands. We are already seeing movement in this direction.

This comes in response to ongoing chip sanctions and aims to protect China's national security interests.  Gallium and germanium are vital components in semiconductor manufacturing, commonly used in electronics, solar panels, and various military applications. Antimony, on the other hand, is essential in flame retardants and batteries. The restrictions on these materials disrupt not only U.S. supply chains but also ripple through global markets, leading to potential price surges and delays in production.  As companies in the tech sector brace for this change, the need for strategic sourcing and diversification becomes paramount. Businesses must evaluate their supply chain resilience and explore alternative suppliers or materials to mitigate risks. Collaboration and innovation will be key as organizations navigate this evolving landscape.  This ban could catalyze a broader reassessment of U.S.-China relations in the tech industry, urging stakeholders to be proactive in their approach. Companies may need to align with policy developments and invest in domestic capabilities to reduce dependence on foreign materials.  Understanding geopolitics is no longer just for policymakers; it’s a key consideration for business leaders across the board. As we move forward, staying informed and agile will be crucial in adapting to these shifts.  How are you preparing your business for potential supply chain disruptions?

Today, I implemented an 8-to-1 demux using multiple 1-to-2 demux modules. This approach demonstrates the power of modularity in hardware design. 💡 Design Approach: Step 1: Use a 1-to-2 demux for the initial level of selection. Step 2: Further divide each output using another 1-to-2 demux. Step 3: Repeat until 8 outputs are achieved. The select lines are distributed hierarchically to control the cascading structure. ⚙️ Why It Matters: Decomposing larger circuits into smaller, reusable components simplifies design and testing while maintaining scalability. 📘 Takeaway: Building complex logic from simpler units is a key principle in digital design.

2024-12-03,Hashem Zarafat,PhD Researcher in Economics | Lecturer | Business Researcher | Accreditation Auditor,"Intel announced retirement of CEO Pat Gelsinger on December 2, 2024.  Companies, like us people, age. They rise with ambition, dominate with energy, and eventually face the inevitable: change and aging. Intel, once the dominant giant of chip manufacturing, now stands at a crossroads, facing a critical phase. The announcement of CEO Pat Gelsinger’s retirement after more than 40 years is not just the end of an era but a reflection of Intel’s challenge to bring back its earlier success. Once the industry’s leader, Intel is now fighting to stay relevant in a world where the rules have shifted, competitors are faster, and the challenges are bigger. Massive investments in AI chips and chip production show Intel's push for reinvention, but the real question is: will it be enough?  In its prime years between 1994 and 2001, Intel’s revenue grew at a robust 14.82%, with an operating margin of 30.68%. Fast-forward to the period from 2012 to 2021, and revenue growth had slowed to 3.88%, although margins remained solid. By 2022-2024, however, the reality of decline emerged: revenue shrank by 11.31%, and operating margins plummeted to a mere 1.69%, according to Damodaran (2024). These numbers reveal a company once dominant, now wrestling with age and fierce competition.  At $18.89 per share on September 8, 2024, Intel presents potential value for patient investors. With even modest revenue growth of 6% and a 20% operating margin, its intrinsic value could rise to $20.85 per share or more, offering an appealing opportunity for those prioritizing resilience over high growth, according to Damodaran (2024). The stock recently hit a support level of $18.50, a price range it last saw in 2010-2012. After declining nearly 73% from March 2021 to September 2024, it rebounded from $18.50, yielding a return of nearly 36% in under three months.  Intel's aim to compete with Nvidia in AI and TSMC in manufacturing, markets where it may not lead, but can still find a profitable niche. Companies like Intel show us that success is not just about growth, but how well they adapt and continue to deliver value. Pat Gelsinger’s departure ends one chapter, but Intel’s reinvention continues.  To succeed, Intel must focus on operational efficiency, avoid chasing unsustainable growth, and prioritize disciplined EPS growth through strategic buybacks, which can help boost EPS, particularly when reinvestment options are limited. In my opinion, rather than pursuing aggressive expansion, Intel should focus on long-term value and profitability. Sometimes growth is not about chasing new markets, rather it is about holding on to the market share and building on existing expertise.  Still, there is reason to be optimistic about Intel’s future!

While national security concerns are valid, these restrictions risk fragmenting the global semiconductor ecosystem that took decades to build.  The automotive sector stands as a prime example of potential collateral damage. Modern EVs require up to 1,600 chips - nearly triple the amount in traditional vehicles. This supply chain disruption could slow down global EV adoption and innovation.  Most concerning is the potential emergence of two separate semiconductor ecosystems - one US-led, one China-led. This bifurcation would increase costs, reduce efficiency, and potentially create incompatible standards that could hinder technological progress for everyone.  The semiconductor industry thrives on global collaboration. Rather than restrictions, perhaps the focus should be on establishing transparent international frameworks that address security concerns while preserving innovation.

Companies that rely on Chinese chips might find themselves scrambling for alternatives, pushing them to either redirect their supply chains or invest heavily in local production.  As professionals in tech and industry, it is crucial to monitor how these changes will affect market dynamics. The semiconductor sector is vital for technological growth, and any disruption could lead to delays in product development and increased costs for consumers.  Moreover, the race for technological supremacy could intensify, with countries around the world reassessing their dependencies on foreign chip production. This development may lead to an increase in investment in domestic industries, as nations strive for self-sufficiency in a critical sector.  What do you think? Is this a necessary step for national security, or could it backfire with unintended consequences? Let’s discuss how these changes might reshape our industry and what strategies companies can adopt to navigate this complex environment.

Fortunately, the , enacted in August 2022, is a bipartisan push to revitalize production, reduce foreign reliance, bolster defense, and drive innovation.  The CHIPS Act was initiated during the Trump administration to address global competition and supply chain vulnerabilities. Under Secretary of State(and Chairman of the) secured a pivotal 2020 agreement with TSMC to build a $12 billion chip plant in the U.S., strengthening the supply chain. The Biden administration expanded on this foundation, securing $52 billion in subsidies to boost manufacturing, research, and workforce development.  While the CHIPS Act offers a historic chance to restore U.S. leadership in semiconductor manufacturing, its success depends on overcoming a key challenge—""building a skilled semiconductor engineering workforce.""  History shows that critical engineering shortages—from the Y2K crisis to the Space Race and post-World War II reconstruction—demonstrate how the U.S. has consistently risen to the challenge, offering valuable lessons in workforce development directly applicable to today's semiconductor talent gap.  (1990s): Rapid reskilling and global collaboration with IT talent from countries like India addressed urgent software engineering needs.  (1950s–60s): Massive STEM education funding and public-private partnerships fueled the development of aerospace and electronics expertise.  -Reconstruction (1940s–50s): Shortened education programs and apprenticeships quickly addressed infrastructure and industrial engineering demands.  -Era (1880s–1920s): Universities and corporations pioneered new training programs for electrical engineers, supported by standardization efforts.  Once again, the U.S. semiconductor industry must address its shortage by reskilling adjacent-field engineers, leveraging global talent, and fostering public-private partnerships. Encouraging semiconductor careers at K-12, streamlining standards to simplify training and foster collaboration, leveraging AI for automation, and fast-tracking work-visa pathways are vital to building a competitive workforce.  While the CHIPS Act mainly supports semiconductor manufacturers, ecosystem providers such as , , , , , and industries can also contribute through workforce development, R&D, and supply chain resilience—potentially qualifying for incentives and amplifying the Act's impact.

However, instead of an outright ban, gallium shipments are now subject to licensing.  Gallium chips are widely used in defense and aerospace technology. Germanium is needed for the production of solar panels.

Η πορεία της Intel από κυρίαρχο κολοσσό της βιομηχανίας σε μια εταιρεία δεύτερης κατηγορίας αποτελεί προειδοποίηση για τους σημερινούς γίγαντες της τεχνολογίας.  Με τον Διευθύνοντα Σύμβουλο της Intel, Pat Gelsinger, να αποχωρεί, είναι δύσκολο να υπερβάλλουμε σχετικά με το πόσο μεγάλη υπήρξε κάποτε η εταιρεία κατασκευής ημιαγωγών. Έχετε ακούσει ποτέ για τον Νόμο του Μουρ, που δηλώνει ότι η υπολογιστική ισχύς των τρανζίστορ διπλασιάζεται κάθε δύο χρόνια; Αυτός ο νόμος διατυπώθηκε από τον Γκόρντον Μουρ, συνιδρυτή της Intel. Ο πρώην CEO Άντριου Γκρόουβ είχε ανακηρυχθεί «Άνθρωπος της Χρονιάς» από το Time το 1997 ως ο άνθρωπος που συνέβαλε περισσότερο στην αξιοποίηση των μικροεπεξεργαστών.  Μαζί με τη Microsoft, η Intel κυριαρχούσε στον τεχνολογικό κόσμο για δεκαετίες, καθώς η αρχιτεκτονική των τσιπ της ενσωματωνόταν σε κάθε προσωπικό υπολογιστή. Ήταν εξαιρετικά κερδοφόρα για μεγάλο χρονικό διάστημα.  Η σύγκριση με τη Microsoft είναι διδακτική. Όταν έγινε σαφές ότι το μέλλον της πληροφορικής ίσως βρίσκεται στα κινητά ή στο cloud και όχι στους υπολογιστές, η Microsoft κατάφερε να ανανεωθεί. Η Intel, αντίθετα, επαναπαύτηκε, επιτρέποντας στην ανταγωνίστρια Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) να αποκτήσει προβάδισμα στην κατασκευή προηγμένων τσιπ, ενώ η Nvidia προχώρησε στη σχεδίαση νέων αρχιτεκτονικών που αποδείχθηκαν ανώτερες για εφαρμογές τεχνητής νοημοσύνης.  Για να είμαστε δίκαιοι, η αποχώρηση του Gelsinger δεν οφείλεται σε αδράνεια. Όταν ανέλαβε το 2021, έκανε μια μεγάλη προσπάθεια να καταστήσει την Intel ανταγωνιστική με την TSMC, κατασκευάζοντας τσιπ στις ΗΠΑ. Ωστόσο, οι δυνάμεις της αγοράς—το φθηνότερο εργατικό δυναμικό στο εξωτερικό και τα τεράστια αρχικά κόστη κατασκευής εργοστασίων—έκαναν να φαίνεται πως προσπαθούσε να πολεμήσει τα κύματα της θάλασσας με καράτε.  Άλλοι παρακολουθούν και μαθαίνουν. Η Nvidia είναι τώρα η κορυφαία εταιρεία τσιπ. Η Apple δεν έχει εφεύρει τίποτα που να πλησιάζει το iPhone εδώ και καιρό. Και η κυριαρχία της μηχανής αναζήτησης της Alphabet (Google) αντιμετωπίζει πολλαπλές απειλές, με την άνοδο της τεχνητής νοημοσύνης να είναι η κύρια ανησυχία.  Ο επόμενος CEO της Intel φαίνεται να έχει λίγες καλές επιλογές για ανατροπή. Ωστόσο, η Apple, που επανήλθε στο προσκήνιο ξεκινώντας με το iPod, προσφέρει άλλο ένα μάθημα από τον κόσμο της τεχνολογίας—οι εταιρείες μπορούν να ανακάμψουν αφού έχουν δεχθεί χτύπημα. —Μπράιαν Σουίντ Barrons",0.5072,POSITIVE,0.7282

These policies may lead to a ""decoupled"" global economy, harming international collaboration and innovation, creating economic fragmentation (such as BRICS - emerging market economy to rival US dollar) and crypto. Stifling another nation’s growth contradicts the US's ideals like freedom and fairness, raising questions about the ethical implications of such strategies and raises moral questions.  Instead of attempting to halt China's advancement, better alternatives may include fostering fair competition and collaboration which could potentially yield better outcomes. This might involve: ensuring transparency and reciprocity in trade and technology agreements; promoting multilateral agreements that address concerns about intellectual property and fair market access and building a system where innovation, not restriction, drives progress. Given history, and opposing ideologies, this seem unlikely.  The US’s efforts to contain China’s rise may reflect a combination of fear, competition, and strategic calculation. While it’s important to address legitimate concerns, actions perceived as oppressive undermine the very values the US claims to uphold. Empathy and a focus on mutual benefit could pave the way for a less adversarial and more cooperative global future.  The US and China are competing for global economic dominance, leading to economic competition and protectionism such as seen in creating technological advantages through blocking access to the latest TSMC chip technologies and national security concerns.  From a Chinese perspective, these actions can appear oppressive, undermining its legitimate economic growth and innovation. Conversely, the US views it as safeguarding its interests.  The dynamics between countries like the US and China often stem from a combination of economic, geopolitical, and ideological concerns rather than purely oppressive authoritarian control motives.",0.5243,NEGATIVE,0.9984

Now, as the administration approaches a transition, the U.S. has unveiled its toughest and most comprehensive semiconductor export restrictions yet. These new measures aim to severely limit China’s ability to produce AI chips domestically. Key Aspects of the New Sanctions: Expanded Restrictions: The latest regulations ban Chinese companies from accessing 24 types of chip manufacturing equipment and 3 types of software programs critical to chip production. Foreign Direct Product Rule Adjusted: The 25% threshold for U.S. components in foreign-made chips has been removed. Any system containing U.S. technology, regardless of percentage, is now restricted. Impact on Companies: 140 Chinese firms, including North Huachuang (Naura), Piotech, ACM Research, and SiCarrier Technology, are now blacklisted, requiring special licenses to acquire U.S. software or products. Huawei’s chip collaborators, like Swaysure and SiEN, are also affected despite recent advancements that rival Western technology. Pressure on Global Suppliers: Companies such as ASML, Canon, and Nikon have been compelled to limit technology exports to China under U.S. influence. Taiwanese chipmaker TSMC has also been directed to halt advanced chip supplies to Chinese clients. Global Ramifications: China’s Ministry of Commerce has strongly condemned these measures, calling them ""economic coercion"" and ""a violation of global trade rules.""

Men hvem har reelt ""prøvet det""? AI-rejsen er stadig i sin spæde fase for de fleste virksomheder. Fokus er derfor fortsat på infrastruktur frem for anvendelse hos investorerne.  𝗡𝗩𝗜𝗗𝗜𝗔 𝗲𝗿 𝗳𝗼𝗿𝘁𝘀𝗮𝘁 𝗸𝗼𝗻𝗴𝗲𝗻 𝗮𝗳 𝗔𝗜! NVIDIAs seneste regnskab overgik igen alle forventninger – om end sekventielt mindre. Efterspørgslen på deres Hopper H100/H200-chips og kommende Blackwell-chips er stærkere end nogensinde, og selskabet forventer en omsætningsstigning på 7 % i næste kvartal.  NVIDIA demonstrerer fortsat sin teknologiske dominans. Alt tyder på, at de igen vil udvide afstanden til resten af markedet med Blackwell-chippen. Håbet og væksten er dog i høj grad bundet op på en succesfuld lancering af Blackwell, hvor netop bekymringer om strømproblemer på chippen blev manet i jorden under deres seneste regnskabskald.  𝗨𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿𝗹𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗻𝗱ø𝗿𝗲𝗿𝗻𝗲 𝗸𝗮𝗻 𝗸𝗻𝗮𝗽 𝗻𝗼𝗸 𝗳ø𝗹𝗴𝗲 𝗺𝗲𝗱: ✔️ Dell oplever eksplosiv efterspørgsel på AI-drevne servere med rekordstore ordrebeholdninger.

Though I think there are some additional aspects to consider here given Pat Gelsinger's departure - though his legacy has been nothing short of legendary.  So, the question is what happened? What went wrong? A bunch of things (within and beyond Pat's control!):  While his efforts to revitalize Intel's manufacturing process through the 5N4Y initiative were noteworthy - but incomplete. To his credit, he recognized the ""death spiral"" the company faced as an IDM with a lagging fab. Catching up to TSMC was always going to be a Herculean task, and his focus there was understandable. However, that focus came at a cost.  The problem was just as much about what Gelsinger didn't do. While pouring energy into manufacturing, he neglected the product side. Intel missed the AI boom, lost data center market share, and failed to articulate a compelling product vision beyond a hopeful ""AI PC super cycle.""  Excellent at manufacturing - perhaps not so much at product.  Now, on to the present: There are recent leadership changes, with Michelle Johnston Holthaus taking the helm of the newly formed ""Intel Products Group"". This dedicated focus on product innovation is long overdue. But Holthaus has her work cut out for her. Can she, with CTO Greg Lavender, truly compete with the likes of Lisa Su and Mark Papermaster at AMD, or Jensen Huang at Nvidia? To be fair her background is in client CPUs – a legacy strength, but is it enough in a world that is dominated by AI and accelerated computing?  I think Gelsinger's departure coupled with the existing structure of the ""independent subsidiary inside of Intel"" model for Foundry, makes a complete spin-off increasingly likely.  The recent 8-K filing referencing a hypothetical ""Intel Foundry Corporation"" within the government subsidies agreement suggests that such a move is being seriously considered. This separation would not only address the conflict of interest inherent in Foundry prioritizing its internal customer (Intel Products) but could also unlock value for both entities. It's worth noting that Gelsinger reportedly resisted this level of unbundling, making his departure potentially significant in this regard.  Does Intel come back? I don't know. It could quite quickly just turn into a case of Intel playing the laggard in an industry where product development is at breakneck pace and entities plan out things decades in advance. AMD is the ONLY company I can think of in that segment that has had a phoenix-like rise after stumbling over and over. Not sure if we can see Intel replicate that.  P.S. In case you didn't know: The Intel board has officially unbundled “Intel [the IDM]” into two divisions: a fabless design group (Products) and a fab (Foundry).

MPI makes it possible to distribute spherical harmonic coefficients and the signal to be analyzed/synthesized among a number of independent shared-memory systems that can communicate together. As a result, it is now fairly possible to perform spherical harmonic transforms up to degrees as high as 100,000 and beyond. This allows us, for instance, to model the Earth's topography at 200-m spatial resolution and higher with .  CHarm now combines three parallelization techniques.

𝑼𝒏 𝒂𝒏𝒏𝒖𝒏𝒄𝒊𝒐 𝒅𝒊 𝒍𝒂𝒗𝒐𝒓𝒐 𝒅𝒂 𝒔𝒐𝒈𝒏𝒐 La posizione è aperta e, a quanto pare, disperatamente vacante. L’azienda, leader nei semiconduttori, cerca un CEO che abbia almeno queste competenze:  1. Gestione del caos: il candidato ideale deve essere in grado di navigare tra competitor agguerriti come AMD e Nvidia, evitando al contempo di perdere terreno contro giganti asiatici come TSMC e Samsung.  2. Visione strategica: non solo per i chip futuri, ma anche per individuare quali business vendere quando tutto va storto.  3. Immune allo stress: resistere al bombardamento di critiche e aspettative irrealistiche mentre si cerca di recuperare il terreno perduto.  4. Creatività contabile: fare miracoli con finanziamenti inferiori alle aspettative e risultati trimestrali altalenanti.  𝑰𝒏𝒕𝒆𝒍 𝑭𝒐𝒖𝒏𝒅𝒓𝒚 𝒆 𝒊 𝒔𝒐𝒈𝒏𝒊 𝒏𝒆𝒍 𝒄𝒂𝒔𝒔𝒆𝒕𝒕𝒐 Il nuovo CEO avrà l’onore e l’onere di capire cosa fare dell’Intel Foundry. Nonostante grandi promesse, i ricavi significativi non si sono ancora visti.

𝑼𝒏𝒂 𝒄𝒓𝒊𝒔𝒊… 𝒇𝒆𝒔𝒕𝒊𝒗𝒂 L'annuncio delle dimissioni è arrivato proprio a ridosso del weekend del Ringraziamento.

Tra riorganizzazioni, tagli, competizione e innovazioni mancate, Intel si trova nel mezzo di una crisi esistenziale. Ma chi lo sa? Forse il prossimo CEO sarà proprio uno di noi, armato di un PowerPoint pieno di slide convincenti e di un cuore di silicio.  Intel, il posto perfetto per chi ama le sfide impossibili.

2024-12-03,KST Components Limited,"1,390 followers","In the third quarter of 2024, global foundry industry revenue increased by 27% year-on-year and 11% quarter-on-quarter. TSMC has a market share of 64%.  TSMC's third quarter performance in 2024 was strong, with strong gross margins exceeding expectations. This success was mainly due to the high utilization of its cutting-edge nodes, including N5 and N3, which benefited from the demand for AI accelerators and the strong seasonality of smartphones. The company expanded its industry revenue share to 64% in the third quarter from 62% in the previous quarter. TSMC expects AI-related demand to grow significantly in the next few years, and AI servers already account for a dozen of its revenue in 2024. The company expects this AI revenue share to grow further in the future as cloud service providers continue to adopt more and practical AI applications emerge. Although the company has announced that it will at least double its CoWoS capacity in 2025, it is still not enough to meet customers' strong demand for AI. In the non-AI semiconductor market, despite continued weak demand, TSMC expects a steady recovery from 2025, alleviating concerns that the semiconductor cycle may have peaked.  Samsung Foundry's revenue increased slightly quarter-on-quarter, mainly due to weaker-than-expected seasonal demand for Android smartphones. However, the company still maintained its second position with a 12% market share in the third quarter of 2024. Samsung Foundry is advancing its 2nm GAA process with the goal of achieving mass production by 2025, focusing on optimizing performance, power and area (PPA) for mobile, HPC, AI and automotive applications. The company is also working with customers to develop advanced 2.5D and 3D packaging solutions to ensure the competitiveness of its 2nm platform through continuous innovation.  SMIC's third quarter 2024 results were strong, with the company reporting strong revenue growth driven by recovering demand for consumer electronics, smartphones and IoT applications. The company's 12-inch wafer shipments increased significantly thanks to an improved product mix and higher average selling prices. SMIC's overall utilization rate rose to 90.4%, reflecting continued strong demand, especially at 28nm, 40nm and 65nm nodes. Although fourth-quarter guidance remains conservative due to expected seasonal weakness, the company remains optimistic about its annual growth prospects, thanks to its focus on leveraging domestic demand and localization efforts.",0.5856,POSITIVE,0.544

2024-12-03,Kakuba Gerald,Hardware Design Engineer at Silicon Mechanics,"I strongly assure everyone reading this that any country accepting the U.S.'s propaganda to restrict its companies from shipping products to Chinese firms will regret it within 15 years.  This strategy mirrors the historical ""divide and rule"" tactic used in Africa. The U.S. aims to consolidate global manufacturing within its territory. Once that goal is achieved, it will impose unfavorable tariffs or push foreign companies out entirely.  By then, these countries will lack viable alternatives. The U.S. will have become significantly stronger, overtaking them in areas where they once excelled. These nations will lose their leverage in negotiations, effectively surrendering their autonomy.  The U.S. strategy is clear: attract companies with cutting-edge technology, like TSMC, ASML, Samsung, and others, to establish branches in the U.S. Over time, these companies will be compelled to prioritize investment and R&D in their U.S.-based campuses. Eventually, their home branches, once proud headquarters, will become mere shadows of their former selves—inferior to their U.S. counterparts.  When this happens, these nations—Japan, the Netherlands, South Korea, the UK, and others—will lose their place at the global negotiating table. They will realize, too late, that they were used as pawns.  My advice to countries with technological assets that the U.S. relies on:  Recognize that these technologies are your leverage, your gold—protect them fiercely.  Avoid taking sides. Stay neutral and maintain your autonomy.  Continue supplying products to all markets, resisting pressure to align with the U.S.'s sanction schemes.   Short-term alignment with the U.S. might seem strategically sound now because their companies are still catching up. However, once the U.S. firms gain dominance, the alliance will lose its value, leaving partner nations at a severe disadvantage.

Just like in politics, it is hard to take charge of a big company after previous years of mismanagement. So, no matter how easy it would be to point out his failures with the last three generations of Intel's CPUs and the too-slow rollout of Intel's dedicated GPUs in the face of much faster-moving competition from AMD and Nvidia, let's focus on what he managed to do right.  Intel is currently the only company capable of chip manufacturing that has the ASML machines able to produce chips at sub-3nm scale in their most recent chip factories on U.S. soil. Yes, TSMC will apparently soon receive them as well, but the head start Intel managed to get in constructing new chip fabs under Gelsinger's leadership has the potential to bring advanced chip production back to the West, which may prove to be very crucial in the current difficult geopolitical climate.  Intel's dedicated GPUs mentioned above may have had a slow rollout and took much longer than originally planned, but this was a step in the right direction. The more competition we have in this very difficult field, the better it is for the whole market. Both end customers, aka gamers, and companies running large AI data centers will eventually benefit from having multiple options when it comes to hardware.  Whoever comes next to fill the CEO role at Intel will greatly benefit from both of these advances made during Gelsinger's tenure at Intel.

It was reported that the board of directors believed that Gelsinger's transformation plan was not effective, so it requested Choose ""Retire"" or ""Dismissed"". But Lu Xingzhi, a well-known semiconductor analyst, believes that the focus now is who the board of directors should find to take over Intel? But the last thing he wants is to see Trump significantly increase tariffs on non-U.S. semiconductor manufacturing to more than 50% in order to save Intel.  Since taking over as CEO of Intel in 2021, Kissinger has proposed a four-year revitalization plan in an attempt to reverse the predicament, but the strategy has not worked. During his tenure, Intel's market value has shrunk significantly and is now only one-thirtieth of Nvidia, which focuses on artificial intelligence chips.  According to Reuters, people familiar with the matter revealed that at last week's Intel board meeting, it was felt that Jissinger's costly transformation plan was progressing slowly and was ineffective, so he was asked to choose ""retirement"" or ""dismissal."" Ge finally chose to retire.  Semiconductor analyst Lu Xingzhi analyzed on Facebook that Ji Xingji originally signed a contract for five years, but ended up packing up and leaving after three years. Was it because the board of directors forced him to retire early before his term was completed? Or are you disappointed and leaving your job because you are trapped in a tight trap that cannot be 100% divided and create cancer? He believes that Kissinji has been not favored not long after taking office, waiting to see when he will be ""let go"" (fired).  Lu Xingzhi further pointed out the contradictory strategies proposed by Ji Xingji, such as finding TSMC to manufacture advanced manufacturing processes, but saying all day long that Taiwan's geopolitics is dangerous; he also vigorously developed wafer foundry and expanded production everywhere to obtain subsidies, which resulted in Intel's collapse. The losses are getting bigger and bigger, and they are out of control.  Lu Xingzhi even mentioned that Ji Xingji set an unachievable goal of five nodes in four years.

A Hot Topic in the Semiconductor Industry  initially predicted that the number of transistors would double every two years, accompanied by improved performance and reduced costs. However, as process technology approaches physical limits, Moore’s Law faces increasing challenges.  🔸 Challenges:  ▪️ Process Limits: As technology advances to 2nm nodes and beyond, physical limitations such as quantum effects, leakage currents, and heat dissipation issues are becoming increasingly difficult to overcome.  ▪️ Rising Costs: Semiconductor manufacturing equipment and design costs have surged with node scaling, making the economic benefits of Moore’s Law less pronounced than before.  ▪️ Technological Bottlenecks: While new materials (e.g., silicon carbide, gallium nitride) and technologies (e.g., 3D packaging, chiplets) offer breakthroughs in performance and efficiency, they no longer solely rely on increasing transistor density.  🔸 Possibilities for Continuation:  ▪️ Innovative Architectures: Improvements in chip design architectures, such as , , and specialized accelerators, allow the spirit of Moore’s Law to persist in new forms—focusing more on performance enhancements rather than just increasing transistor density.  ▪️ 3D ICs and Advanced Packaging: The focus of innovation is shifting from process scaling to vertical integration (e.g., ’s and ’s ). This approach not only boosts performance but also extends the economic benefits of Moore’s Law.  ▪️ Quantum Computing and Emerging Technologies: Although not yet fully mature, technologies such as quantum computing and photonic computing may transcend the limitations of traditional semiconductors, paving new paths for Moore’s Law.  While the continuation of Moore’s Law in its traditional sense may become increasingly difficult, its spirit—enhancing performance and reducing costs—will likely endure in new technological forms and innovative architectures. The future of Moore’s Law will depend more on the synergy of material science, , computational architectures, and emerging technologies rather than solely on transistor scaling.

2024-12-03,"Sinan Othman, Ph.D.",Product Management & Business Development Leader,"Intel Corp. Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger was forced out after the board lost confidence in his plans to turn around the iconic chipmaker, adding to turmoil at one of the pioneers of the technology industry.  The clash came to a head last week when Gelsinger met with the board about the company’s progress on winning back market share and narrowing the gap with Nvidia Corp., according to people familiar with the matter. He was given the option to retire or be removed, and chose to announce the end of his career at Intel, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the proceedings weren’t made public.  Intel Chief Financial Officer David Zinsner and Executive Vice President Michelle Johnston Holthaus are serving as interim co-CEOs while the board searches for Gelsinger’s replacement, the company said in a statement. Frank Yeary, independent chair of the board of Intel, will serve as interim executive chair.  Gelsinger, 63, was once hailed as a savior of the chip giant. After taking the reins three years ago, he professed his love for the company and said he was determined to restore it to preeminence in the semiconductor industry. The executive first began working at Intel when he was a teenager but left in 2009 and became CEO of VMware Inc. Upon returning in 2021, he promised to regain the chipmaker’s lead in manufacturing — something it had lost to rivals like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.  Gelsinger couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.  Intel investors, eager to see changes at the company, applauded the CEO’s departure. The shares gained as much as 6% in New York on Monday, though they remain down about 50% this year.  Gelsinger set out to take Intel beyond its traditional strength in personal computer and server processors by expanding into making chips for other companies — something it had never done before and putting it into direct competition with TSMC and Samsung Electronics Co. As part of his revival strategy, Gelsinger laid out a costly plan to expand Intel’s factory network. That included building a massive new complex in Ohio, a project for which the company received federal aid from the Chips and Science Act.  Whoever replaces Gelsinger will face the same set of problems he was brought in to fix, including the fallout from poor decisions made by his predecessors. What would have once been the most desirable job in the $500 billion chip industry has become a nearly untenable position. The next CEO has to take on competitors with greater resources and catch up in AI computing, all while showing that Intel can be the groundbreaking company it once was.  Finding someone to take that hot seat may not be easy. Before Gelsinger was appointed to replace CEO Bob Swan, there was speculation that a number of prominent executives were possible candidates. Many on Wall Street proposed approaching Advanced Micro Devices Inc.’s Lisa Su for the job. [...]",0.5504,NEGATIVE,0.9965

Gelsinger, die op 1 december ontslag nam, vertrok na een bestuursvergadering vorige week waarin directeuren vonden dat het kostbare en ambitieuze plan van Gelsinger om Intel om te draaien niet werkte en dat de voortgang van de verandering niet snel genoeg was, volgens een persoon die bekend is met de zaak. Het bestuur vertelde Gelsinger dat hij met pensioen kon gaan of verwijderd kon worden, en hij koos ervoor om af te treden, aldus de bron.  Zijn vertrek komt ruim voor de voltooiing van zijn vierjarige routekaart om de voorsprong van het bedrijf in het maken van de snelste en kleinste computerchips te herstellen, een kroon die het verloor aan TSMC, die chips maakt voor Intel-rivalen zoals Nvidia. Onder Gelsinger is Intel, dat in 1968 werd opgericht en decennialang de basis vormde van de wereldwijde dominantie van Silicon Valley op het gebied van chips, verschrompeld tot een marktwaarde die meer dan 30 keer kleiner is dan Nvidia, de leider op het gebied van kunstmatige-intelligentiechips.  Gelsinger erfde in 2021 een bedrijf vol uitdagingen die hij verergerde. Intel stelde hoge ambities voor productie- en AI-capaciteiten bij grote klanten, maar verloor of annuleerde uiteindelijk contracten onder zijn toezicht en was niet in staat om de beloofde goederen te leveren, volgens een speciaal rapport van Reuters in oktober. Hij deed optimistische beweringen over toekomstige AI-chipdeals die Intels eigen schattingen overtroffen, waardoor het bedrijf ongeveer een maand geleden een recente omzetprognose schrapte.  Bloomberg berichtte eerder over de omstandigheden rond de pensionering van Gelsinger. Gelsinger, 63, heeft zowel investeerders als Amerikaanse functionarissen, die de ommekeer van Intel subsidiëren, verzekerd dat zijn productieplannen op schema blijven. Maar de volledige resultaten zullen pas volgend jaar bekend zijn, wanneer het bedrijf ernaar streeft een vlaggenschip-laptopchip terug in zijn eigen fabrieken te brengen.",0.5074,POSITIVE,0.9969

Example: TSMC's new fab in Arizona is estimated to cost over $40 billion.  The extreme precision required in semiconductor manufacturing necessitates cleanroom environments and specialized equipment, significantly driving up costs.  🚀 Semiconductor fabrication plant (fab)  Moore's Law, which states that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles approximately every two years, 1 continues to drive rapid innovation.  Example: The transition from 7nm to 5nm and now 3nm process nodes requires significant R&D investments and technological breakthroughs.  The relentless pace of technological advancement forces chipmakers to constantly invest in research and development to stay competitive.  🚀 Complex Manufacturing Process:  Semiconductor manufacturing involves hundreds of steps, each with a low margin of error.  Example: Photolithography, a critical step in chipmaking, requires precise alignment of masks to create intricate circuit patterns.  The intricate and delicate nature of the manufacturing process necessitates highly skilled workers, advanced equipment, and stringent quality control measures.  🚀 Semiconductor manufacturing process  Semiconductor chips are manufactured in a global supply chain involving multiple countries and regions.  Example: A single chip may involve components sourced from the US, Europe, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan.  The complex and interconnected nature of the global supply chain makes it vulnerable to geopolitical tensions, trade disputes, and natural disasters, which can disrupt production and increase costs.  🚀 Highly Skilled Workforce:  Semiconductor engineers and technicians require years of specialized training and education.  Example: A semiconductor engineer may need a PhD in electrical engineering or materials science.  The demand for highly skilled workers in the semiconductor industry often exceeds supply, making it challenging to attract and retain top talent.

Various local investment advisors have also released their outlooks for Taiwan stocks in 2025 at the end of this month, and most of them are optimistic that Taiwan stocks will challenge new highs next year, with Monte Jade and CITIC giving the highest high of 27,500 points.  Regarding the outlook for 2025, all the investment advisors believe that the profits of Taiwan's listed companies and Taiwan's GDP are expected to continue to grow, which is expected to further boost the weighted index, and each advisor predicts that Taiwan stocks will reach a high of 25,000 to 27,500 points next year. However, it is still necessary to pay attention to the policies introduced by Donald Trump after his inauguration, which may affect the stock market due to political and economic uncertainties. If there is a pullback, the lows predicted by various investment advisors are around 20,000~21,500 points, and there will be a strong support near the annual line, which is considered by the advisors to be a good opportunity to lay out the market on the low side.  Cathay United Bank's chief economist Lin Kai-chiu believes that next year will be a year of “chaos and prosperity”, considering Trump's possible immigration and tariff policies, which will lead to a “chaotic world” of the economy once it happens, but due to the market's abundant capital, resulting in the financial sector is still “prosperity”, corporate surpluses are expected to grow by double digits, and optimistic about the performance of the stock markets in Taiwan and the U.S. in 2025, with the Taiwanese stock market expecting to see double-digit growth. In addition, the stock market performance of Taiwan and the U.S. in 2025 is optimistic, with Taiwan's stock market expected to see double-digit growth, and the index is expected to break through 25,000 points next year to reach a new high.  Fan Zhenhong, General Manager of Quni Investment Consulting, predicts that the biggest external variables in 2025 will be Trade War 2.0 and Trump 2.0, and TSMC (2330) will still lead the attack throughout the year. Quni's team predicts that the target price of TSMC in 2025 will be NT$1,380, which translates into the annual high of the weighted index to challenge 26,500 points, with the possible time point falling in Q1 or Q4, and the low point falling in the annual line position of 21,500 points.

2024-12-03,ANNY Y.,Semiconductor Distributor | Workwear Supplier | Startupper | Runner,"hashtag #Intel's board gave CEO Pat Gelsinger the option to retire or be removed due to concerns over the progress of his ambitious turnaround plan, which sought to restore the company to its former leadership in the industry. Despite Gelsinger's efforts to reinvigorate Intel with large investments in manufacturing and technology, the company struggled with delays in its chip production timeline, losing ground to competitors like TSMC and AMD. These challenges, combined with the growing pressure from investors for faster results and improved financial performance, led the board to reassess Gelsinger’s leadership. His plan, though bold, faced significant execution hurdles, and ultimately, Intel's board needed to determine whether a change in leadership would better position the company for future success.  Intel’s recent self-rescue efforts over the past few months can be distilled into three key strategies: -Burden reduction  -External assistance -Pie-in-the-sky ambitions  Despite these efforts, Intel’s self-rescue measures have been met with mixed results. The foundry business is still far from turning around, and the company's competitive position in the semiconductor market remains fragile. Intel’s delays in advancing its process nodes, especially compared to TSMC, are worrying. The new Arizona wafer factory, which was supposed to come online in 2025, is also facing delays, further complicating Intel’s ability to meet its 18A goals. Moreover, Intel’s product performance has been underwhelming, with its new Core Ultra 200 series processors failing to generate the expected market excitement.  Intel’s efforts to capitalize on the AI boom have not yet paid off either. Despite Gelsinger's optimism about Intel’s AI roadmap, market realities tell a different story. The company’s Gaudi chips, which were touted as a major growth driver, have underperformed. Sales expectations for the Gaudi series have been slashed, and shipments of the upcoming Gaudi 3 chip are expected to be reduced by at least 30% in 2025.  Intel’s road to recovery remains long and uncertain. The company’s ambitious plans, from the 18A process to AI-driven products, are still in their infancy, and the challenges they face in execution are significant. While Intel has made progress in reducing costs and seeking external help, it remains to be seen whether these measures will be enough to restore the company to its former glory. The real test will come when the 18A process is put into mass production and when Intel’s AI products are tested in the marketplace. For now, investors and industry watchers are holding their breath, hoping that Intel can turn things around—but the road ahead is anything but clear.

Xie Jinhe: Semiconductors have reached a critical moment  TSMC's stock price is struggling, recently trading around 1,000 yuan after a drop to 992 yuan. Xie Jinhe, chairman of Xinhua Media, links this decline to former President Trump's claims about American technology theft, contributing to the broader downturn in the Taiwan stock market. He identifies three main challenges for TSMC and the Taiwanese semiconductor sector: Trump's statements, competitive pressures from China's mature processes, and a decline in demand from China.  In November, TSMC's stock fell by 44 yuan, from 1,090 to 992 yuan. Xie emphasized that the semiconductor industry is at a critical juncture, with Taiwanese companies facing not just fundamental issues but also uncertainties from Trump's variable stance and competition from China. Other firms like UMC and AMD are already feeling the pressure, with UMC's stock dropping by 9.55% in November.  Xie warns that losing the edge in mature processes would significantly impact TSMC, which is already seeing price reductions in its mature process products. The previously high demand from China has diminished, leading to a decline in stock prices for global semiconductor equipment manufacturers, including ASML and Applied Materials. This trend indicates substantial challenges ahead for TSMC in a difficult market environment.    Want more analysis of major developments in AI, semiconductors, and cloud computing in Asia?

Frank Yeary, independent chair of the board of Intel will serve as Interim Executive Chair.  💻 Intel’s Foundry Dilemma And Its AI Woes  Artificial intelligence computing is a sector that cost Intel billions in revenue. This money that could have gone to Intel’s data centre business was instead taken by Nvidia which turned its GPUs into essential components of AI computing.  💻 Gelsinger’s plan to explore avenues beyond personal computing and server processors such as making chips for other companies, a.k.a., its foundry business was unprecedented.  💻 While companies like Qualcomm and MediaTek chose to outsource their chip needs, Intel looked inward. It put the American tech giant in a head-to-head battle with companies like Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC).  💻 The Intel Foundry has been on a promising growth curve and roadmap but it needed a ""big reset"" in terms of leadership. With Gelsinger gone, the new CEO needs to approach AI chip innovation more aggressively.  💻 Arm Wrestling: Is Intel Losing?  The uprising of Arm-based processors is not a new story. Arm chips have been in the play for quite some time now. Cut to 2024 and we have all of the major OEMs in personal computing implementing Arm chips in their notebooks. Leading this list is Apple Silicon followed by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X Elite.  💻 Currently, while Arm-based PCs control about 18 per cent of the notebook market, this number is projected to reach 40 per cent by 2025 as more Windows on Arm AI PCs are available. Meanwhile, Intel commands over 70 per cent of the x86 notebook market which is slowly slipping away.  💻 What’s Next For Intel: 18A To The Rescue?  Intel is banking heavily on the 18A to attract customers and boost revenue. Not that it already isn’t contributing to Intel’s growth. Intel has already gotten contracts from the US Department of Defense, Boeing, AWS and Microsoft. Plus, a push for AI chip innovation and advanced chip packaging will be key.

However, rather than waiting passively, Intel is proactively strengthening its leadership bench by adding two seasoned executives to its board of directors: Eric Meurice, the former CEO of ASML, and Steve Sanghi, the interim CEO of Microchip Technology.  Both new board members bring an immense wealth of semiconductor manufacturing experience, which Intel needs as it continues to navigate the rapidly evolving tech landscape. Meurice's expertise from ASML, a company central to the production of cutting-edge semiconductor equipment, and Sanghi’s leadership in microchip technology at Microchip Technology will offer Intel critical insights as it drives forward innovation in semiconductor design and manufacturing.  This strategic shift is a strong signal that Intel is not only focused on finding a new CEO but is also committed to reinforcing its leadership in the semiconductor space. With Intel’s ambition to lead in advanced chip technology, having executives with deep operational experience in this sector is vital. In a broader context, this move is a reminder of the importance of resilient leadership in times of transition.  Similarly, in Canada, companies in the tech and manufacturing sectors are also recognizing the value of enhancing leadership diversity and expertise to navigate technological advancements. Companies like and have increasingly turned to seasoned professionals from the tech industry to fill critical roles, ensuring they stay ahead in an ever-changing market.  This shift in Intel’s leadership could well set a precedent for how major corporations in North America address leadership transitions. As businesses face new challenges whether in technology, supply chains, or global competition, the ability to rapidly adjust leadership to meet these challenges is becoming a critical success factor.  What are your thoughts on Intel’s leadership strategy? How important do you think it is for companies to diversify and strengthen their leadership teams during CEO transitions? I’d love to hear your thoughts. let’s keep the conversation going.",0.55,POSITIVE,0.999

He Destroyed $150 Billion of Value Instead.  Pat Gelsinger was one of the chip pioneer’s true believers. After his rescue strategy failed, the board lost confidence in him. How does this iconic American company survive?  Pat Gelsinger’s tenure as Intel’s CEO was marked by bold ambitions to revitalize the semiconductor giant through his IDM 2.0 strategy, a $20 billion investment in U.S. chip manufacturing, and championing the 2022 Chips Act. Despite his efforts to transform Intel into a leading contract chipmaker to compete with TSMC and Samsung, the company struggled with cultural inertia, a lack of competitive customers, and slower-than-expected advancements in chip technology. Under Gelsinger’s leadership, Intel lost $150 billion in market value and faced its largest quarterly loss of $16.6 billion, ultimately leading to his departure. The question looms: Will Intel split its design and manufacturing operations, undoing Gelsinger’s vision entirely?  My Take  Pat Gelsinger’s story is a masterclass in the challenges of corporate transformation at scale. While his vision of reintegrating design and manufacturing could have future merit, it highlights the importance of aligning bold strategies with cultural adaptability and operational execution.

The author thinks that Intel shoudl focus on IFS and not on X86 architecture. While only China could build up a Foundry competing with TSMC, the time has passed for the US and UE.  Intel's Board of Directors: A Catalyst for Decline  This paper provides a comprehensive examination of Intel's leadership issues, strategic missteps, and eroding market position.  • Board incompetence: 7 of 11 members lack relevant semiconductor experience • Cultural shift: From engineering focus to business-oriented management • Process technology failures: 10nm node debacle allowed competitors to gain market share • Erosion of x86 dominance: Rise of Arm-based processors in client and server markets  The authors trace Intel's problems to the appointment of Paul Otellini as CEO, marking a shift from technical leadership to business-oriented management. This change led to a cultural transformation that prioritized political power over technical excellence.  Intel's failure in developing its 10nm process node is identified as a critical turning point, enabling competitors like TSMC and AMD to gain significant market share. The paper also discusses the erosion of Intel's x86 moat in both client and server markets, with Arm-based processors and accelerated computing solutions posing significant threats.  The analysis extends to Intel's financial decisions, criticizing the focus on stock buybacks over capital expenditures during Bob Swan's tenure as CEO. This approach is described as malpractice in a capital-intensive industry when the company was losing market share and lagging in process technology.  The paper argues that Intel's board has made a series of poor decisions, culminating in the dismissal of Pat Gelsinger and a renewed focus on x86 products. The authors contend that this strategy is misguided and unlikely to address Intel's fundamental challenges.  Limitations of the study include potential bias in assessing board decisions and a focus on internal factors without fully exploring external market dynamics. The analysis may also underestimate the challenges faced by Arm-based processors in fully displacing x86 in certain markets.  This comprehensive analysis provides valuable insights into the challenges faced by established technology companies in maintaining market leadership and the critical role of board decisions in shaping a company's trajectory.",0.548,NEGATIVE,0.998

2024-12-13,Francis Benistant,Executive Director at Technology Modeling Automation,"hashtag #CMOS  hashtag #transistors  hashtag #FinFET  hashtag #GAAFET  hashtag #5nmnode  hashtag #devicephysics  hashtag #integratedcircuits  hashtag #nanoelectronics  hashtag #chipdesign  hashtag #VLSI  hashtag #SOC  hashtag #microelectronics  hashtag #TCAD  hashtag   This study compares, using TCAD, FinFETs (PFFETs) and gate-all-around FETs (GAAFETs) at the 5nm CMOS technology node, challenging assumptions about future transistor designs. It explains why TSMC was right to push the FF until 3nm and not to move to GAA too early like SEC has done.  The research uses 3D numerical simulations to analyze and compare the performance of PFFETs and GAAFETs for high-performance (HP) and low-operation-power (LOP) applications. Results show comparable integration densities based on 6T-SRAM cell layouts for both device types.  For HP applications, PFFETs and GAAFETs demonstrate similar drive currents and intrinsic delays. In LOP scenarios, GAAFETs initially outperform PFFETs, but optimizing the PFFET's effective channel length can enhance its competitiveness.  Key innovations:  • Design of a pragmatic FinFET with simplified processing • Comparison of PFFET and GAAFET performance at 5nm node • Analysis of integration density using 6T-SRAM layouts • Optimization of G-S/D underlap for PFFET performance  The study addresses the challenge of continued CMOS scaling, questioning the presumption that GAAFETs will necessarily replace FinFETs at advanced nodes. It explores the tradeoffs between device performance and processing complexity.  Limitations include simplifications in the simulations and the extent of the benchmark. The study focuses on Si-based devices and does not extensively explore alternative materials or more complex GAAFET designs.  The findings suggest that PFFETs may be a viable and potentially preferable alternative to GAAFETs for future nanoscale CMOS technology, considering the balance between performance and processing complexity.",0.511,POSITIVE,0.986

That is why building a strong semiconductor ecosystem is both an economic goal and a strategic need. While India is great at designing chips, setting up advanced manufacturing for semiconductors is still a challenge.  India’s success in chip design comes from its skilled workforce and strong IT sector. Global companies like Intel, Qualcomm, AMD and Broadcom have set up research centers across the country, using its talent to design complex chips for various uses. This shows the nation’s potential to play a bigger role in the global semiconductor market.  To fix its manufacturing gap, the India Semiconductor Mission (ISM) in 2021, offering financial help to promote semiconductor production. It is also working with global leaders such as Taiwan’s TSMC and the U.S.-based Synopsys to gain knowledge and build manufacturing facilities. India’s progress in building its own semiconductor system can be seen in new fab units being set up. Tata Semiconductor is building a plant in Assam, expected to be ready by mid-2025. In Gujarat, Tata Electronics and Taiwan’s PSMC are making two factories, with one expected to start production in 2026.  This will reduce its need to import chips and ensure a steady supply for important industries. It will also boost India’s position in the global semiconductor market, especially in uncertain times. Supporting this optimism, Jensen Huang, the CEO of NVIDIA, has publicly stated that ""This is India’s moment."" When a global tech leader of such stature bets on India, it signals a pivotal opportunity that Indians and the world cannot ignore.  India’s journey in semiconductors is full of promise. Its strength in chip design provides a good start, but moving into manufacturing will need to overcome challenges. With smart investments, international partnerships, and supportive policies, there is optimism that India can become a global leader in semiconductors.",0.54,POSITIVE,0.998

The number of Taiwanese working abroad reached a four-year high of 621,000 in 2023. A record 128,000 were employed in the US, per CNA. DGBAS Deputy Director Tan Wen-ling (譚文玲) linked this rise to TSMC's upcoming fabs in Arizona and the company's global expansion. This has driven a surge in Taiwanese workers in the US and Japan. Between 2009 and 2019, the number of Taiwanese working abroad grew from 662,000 to 739,000. The US-China trade war, technological disputes, supply chain restructuring, and COVID-19-related travel restrictions caused a drop in overseas employment, reaching a low of 319,000 in 2021. As the pandemic's impact waned, the number of Taiwanese working overseas rebounded in 2022 and 2023. It reached 621,000 in 2023, a year-on-year increase of 148,000, although still below pre-pandemic levels. While China remained the leading destination with 217,000 Taiwanese workers in 2023, its share dropped to 35%, down from 62.2% in 2011.

Hmm where do we go from here?🤔😃  Alright,now imagine you want to design a microchip. To do that, you need a guide to make sure your design can actually be built by a semiconductor factory (foundry). A Process Design Kit (PDK) is that guide.  A Process Design Kit (PDK) is like a guide for designing microchips. It includes design rules, models for how components behave electrically, and tools to check if a design can be made into a real chip. It helps ensure that the design will be manufacturable.  For the process node (like 5nm or 7nm),it refers to the size of the features on the chip. Smaller nodes allow more transistors, improving performance and power efficiency. However, each semiconductor company (e.g., TSMC, Intel, Samsung) has its own way of making chips, even for the same node size. This means that each company provides a different PDK, customized to their specific technology, materials, and performance goals. For example, one company may focus on mobile devices while another targets high-performance computing.  The rise of open access PDKs is changing the game. These are free and available to anyone, which allows smaller companies, universities, and even hobbyists to design chips without high costs. A good example is the Google-SkyWater 130nm PDK, which opened chip design to the public. This has made chip design more accessible and encouraged innovation by letting more people experiment with and create their own chips.  In short, PDKs are essential for chip design, and open access PDKs are making it easier and cheaper for a wider range of people to get involved in semiconductor development.  What do you think about PDKs? Let's meet at the comment section 👇",0.534,POSITIVE,0.997
