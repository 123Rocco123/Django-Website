Die Geschäftszahlen des Technologie-Schwergewichts NVIDIA für das dritte Quartal übertrafen zwar bei Umsatz und Gewinn die Prognosen, doch konnte der Ausblick angesichts der schon sehr hohen Erwartungen keine neue Euphorie-Welle auslösen. Kryptowährungen profitierten von anhaltenden positiven Aussagen des neu gewählten Präsidenten im Wartestand Donald Trump. Fehlende staatliche Anerkennung war bislang ein besonderer Nachteil der Kryptowelt. Wie weit eine solche Anerkennung unter der neuen Trump-Regierung allerdings reicht, bleibt ungewiss. Auch der Goldpreis nahm seinen von Zentralbankkäufen getragenen Aufwärtstrend der vergangenen Monate wieder auf. Die ersten Wirtschaftsprognosen nehmen die von der neuen US-Regierung geplanten Maßnahmen in ihren Ausblick auf und sehen eher geringe negative Auswirkungen der angekündigten Zollmaßnahmen auf das US-Wachstum voraus.  Tristesse lautet dagegen der Gemütszustand in der europäischen Wirtschaft. Das Zahlenwerk für das deutsche Bruttoinlandsprodukt im dritten Quartal offenbarte die Fortsetzung der Erosion in der Industrie.

Der schleppende Absatz lässt die Fertigwarenlager der Unternehmen volllaufen, was nichts Gutes für die Produktionsaussichten der kommenden Monate bedeutet.

2024-11-23,Pascal Biese,Daily AI highlights for 60k+ experts 📲🤗 AI/ML Engineer,"Transformers + Mamba = Hy(𝘣𝘳𝘪𝘥 𝘮𝘢)mba   Researchers from NVIDIA just released Hymba, a new family of small language models that combines the best of both worlds: attention heads and state space model (SSM) heads.  Their key contributions are:  1. Hybrid-head parallel architecture: Attention heads provide high-resolution recall, while SSM heads enable efficient context summarization. This allows Hymba to capture both fine-grained details and the bigger picture.  2. Learnable meta tokens: These special tokens are prepended to prompts and act as a learned cache, storing critical information. This alleviates the ""forced-to-attend"" burden on the attention mechanism, making the model more focused.  3. Cross-layer key-value sharing and partial sliding window attention: These optimizations result in a compact cache size, further boosting efficiency.  Results: Hymba-1.5B-Base outperforms all sub-2B public models and even surpasses Llama-3.2-3B with 1.32% higher average accuracy, an 11.67x cache size reduction, and 3.49x throughput.  In other words, the model delivers state-of-the-art performance in a smaller package.  The hybrid-head architecture in particular offers a promising direction for future research, demonstrating the power of hybrid architectures in achieving both accuracy and efficiency.

One powerful approach is RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).  While models like ChatGPT are designed to generate responses based on patterns in training data, RAG takes it a step further by integrating external knowledge sources in real-time.  Here’s how it works: 1️⃣ Retrieval: Fetch relevant information from a database or documents (e.g., ChromaDB). 2️⃣ Generation: Use an LLM to craft responses based on the retrieved data.  In a recent project, I combined ChromaDB with an LLM to build a chatbot tailored for answering domain-specific questions. This approach ensures: ✅ Highly accurate responses. ✅ Relevance for specialized datasets. ✅ Real-time adaptability.  Now, I’m taking it further—exploring evaluation metrics to measure the performance of my RAG-based chatbot. It’s a crucial step to ensure its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.  Have you experimented with RAG or similar techniques? What use cases do you think benefit most from this approach? Let’s discuss in the comments!"

2024-11-26,Azizi Othman,AI & Robotics | IT Professional | Exploring the Impact of Emerging Technologies on Society & Business,"NVIDIA Has A New AI Model That Can Create Sounds With Text Prompts  NVIDIA is a company that’s no stranger to generative AI, and probably has the most unique contribution to the field, with AI-generated NPCs for games. A lot of this includes generating voices for said non-player characters, and it looks like the company is taking the audio generative AI to the next level with a new AI model that it calls Fugatto.  As is usual, Fugatto (which stands for Foundational Generative Audio Transformer Opus 1) works by using text prompts, but you can also add in audio bases for it to work with. You can do the usual music creation based on said text prompt, or get it to add or remove instruments from a clip you provide. You can also get it to generate a voice line, and then modify it to having an angry or calm tone, for instance.  Source: Nvidia.  In the blog post, NVIDIA calls Fugatto the Swiss Army knife for sound, capable of even producing “sounds never heard before”. Which, while impressive, is still quite the claim. In a YouTube video, the company demos some of these generations which are perhaps unique permutations of sounds, though one can argue that they are combinations of sounds they’ve definitely heard before.  All that being said though, it certainly sounds more capable than other audio generation tools currently out there. Though it remains to be seen if it’s something that anyone can get to use, as the NVIDIA omitted the mention of availability in said blog post.

2024-11-26,Marius Pantea,Consulting Intermediary Agency Ltd,"Navigating the world of tech investments can be a rollercoaster ride. Recently, some analysts have suggested that Nvidia's explosive growth may be slowing down. However, there's more to the story than just numbers on a chart.  Nvidia has earned its reputation as a leader in the semiconductor industry, especially with its powerful GPUs that dominate not just gaming but also burgeoning fields like artificial intelligence and data centers. While some may argue that the hype around AI has peaked, the underlying demand for high-performance computing continues to expand. Companies across various sectors are only beginning to tap into the potential of AI, meaning Nvidia is well-positioned for continued relevance.  Furthermore, Nvidia's strategic moves—like its foray into the automotive sector and partnerships with cloud service providers—speak to a robust long-term growth strategy. Their push into software and services adds another dimension to their revenue streams, reducing reliance on any single market.  Investing isn’t just about riding the waves; it’s about recognizing solid companies that adapt and evolve. Nvidia’s commitment to innovation keeps the company at the forefront of technology trends. If you're still interested in tech investments, overlooking Nvidia might mean missing out on a potential goldmine.  So, while the chatter about a slowdown may cause some investors to hesitate, I’m ready to double down on Nvidia. The potential for growth in AI, gaming, and more is simply too compelling to ignore.  Have you considered the broader implications of Nvidia’s strategy? Let’s talk about it in the comments.  Source:"

However, other stocks also offer buying potential right now, given their low valuations and future growth. Wall Street’s price targets agree with this view, suggesting that there is more upside in the coming months that investors need to consider. The tech sector has been in the spotlight lately, especially the semiconductor sector and its big news. Of all the businesses centered around the sector, two companies are getting the most attention today, for both good and bad reasons.  NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA ) has been the darling of the AI and semiconductor sectors for over a year now, but the recent allegations and speculation surrounding Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI ) have brought some positives that investors must now weigh and deal with to protect their capital in the coming quarters. With the troubles surrounding Super Micro Computer stock resolved soon, NVIDIA could be on the way out.  But if the news is not good, the stock could also fall sharply, which is why investors should have a backup plan when chasing the next wave of gains in semiconductors and AI. With that in mind, it's helpful to consider stocks like Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) and its potential buyer, Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ). In addition, Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU ) is also trading at a significant discount and is worth considering."

Its poster boy's share price 📈 (guess who) is up more than 8x over this time period. The other magnificent 6 🌟 have also seen a rise in their share prices underpinned by robust earnings 💰 and ongoing capital investment into AI.  As an investor, it wouldn't be remiss to ask - ""Is AI a bubble? "". As a business, does it make sense to sink billions of dollars 💸 into ever larger AI projects?  Fundamentally, long term share price is driven by earnings. As one of the pick and shovel 🛠️ powering the 'AI bubble',earnings have 10x 📊 since 4Q 2022, with its data centre segment contributing almost 90% of revenue in the most recent quarter. Juxtapose its earnings against share price and you'll see what I mean.  Whether there is a clear revenue model for other businesses that heavily invest in AI has yet to be seen. It could take some time ⏳to materialise.  As this spinning AI trend unfolds, an ever-shifting macro environment plays out in the background, influenced by among other things politics 🏛️ (Trump), geopolitics 🌏 (US-China) and monetary policy 💵 (Fed).

What About Intel or AMD? After a long break, I’ve returned to blogging, and I believe it’s a great way to stay updated with market trends while learning new things. I invite you to spend a few minutes reading this blog as we explore a question that crosses everyone’s mind when discussing AI and ML: Why is NVIDIA dominating the GPU market? Currently, NVIDIA stands as the clear leader in GPUs for AI and ML applications. But will Intel or AMD catch up? Perhaps. However, the rise of competitors would only amplify the competitive edge NVIDIA brings to the table. In this fast-evolving AI landscape, NVIDIA’s position could be seen as “Next Vision Envy,” setting the benchmark for innovation and performance."

""I can now say with absolute confidence that many AI systems have been trained on TV and film writers’ work. Not just on The Godfather and Alf, but on more than 53,000 other movies and 85,000 other TV episodes: Dialogue from all of it is included in an AI-training data set that has been used by Apple, Anthropic, Meta, Nvidia, Salesforce, Bloomberg, and other companies. I recently downloaded this data set, which I saw referenced in papers about the development of various large language models (or LLMs). It includes writing from every film nominated for Best Picture from 1950 to 2016, at least 616 episodes of The Simpsons, 170 episodes of Seinfeld, 45 episodes of Twin Peaks, and every episode of The Wire, The Sopranos, and Breaking Bad. It even includes prewritten “live” dialogue from Golden Globes and Academy Awards broadcasts. If a chatbot can mimic a crime-show mobster or a sitcom alien—or, more pressingly, if it can piece together whole shows that might otherwise require a room of writers—data like this are part of the reason why.""

Fugatto blends text prompts with advanced audio synthesis capabilities, making sound inputs highly flexible for creative experimentation—such as changing a piano line into a human voice singing or making a trumpet produce unexpected sounds. The model supports both text and optional audio inputs, enabling it to create and manipulate sounds in ways that go beyond conventional audio generation models. This versatile approach allows for real-time experimentation, enabling artists and developers to generate new types of sounds or modify existing audio fluidly. NVIDIA’s emphasis on flexibility allows Fugatto to excel at tasks involving complex compositional transformations, making it a valuable tool for artists and audio producers. A key innovation is the Composable Audio Representation Transformation (ComposableART), an inference-time technique developed to extend classifier-free guidance to compositional instructions. This enables Fugatto to combine, interpolate, or negate different audio generation instructions smoothly, opening new possibilities in sound creation. ComposableART provides a high level of control over synthesis, allowing users to navigate Fugatto’s sonic palette with precision, blending different sounds and generating unique sonic phenomena....

2024-11-26,Ronaldo Polo,--,"Amazon wants to build its own artificial intelligence chips. The e-commerce giant, which recently expanded its partnership with AI giant Anthropic, hopes to loosen Nvidia’s grip on the market, according to Bloomberg, and is doing so by building its own chips in a Texas lab. Nvidia, which surpassed Apple to become the world's largest company in market value, dominates as the main supplier of hardware for AI chips. However, its biggest customers, including Amazon and Alphabet, ""are eager to reduce their reliance on, if not replace, Nvidia chips."" But experts believe that Amazon isn't likely to shift Nvidia's pole position in the near future."
2024-11-26,"Dr. Lawrence A. Souza, DBA, CRE, FRICS, CCIM","Managing Director - Commercial Institutional Investment Sales, Finance and Research at Brookwood-Starboard Commercial","Wall Street rebounded from last week's retreat with a nearly 2% advance over the last five days, and the benchmark S&P 500 (SP500) is now only -0.8% from its record intraday high.  It was a week marked by steady gains, geopolitical tensions arising from developments in the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, chip giant Nvidia's (NVDA) quarterly results, and a furious rally in bitcoin (BTC-USD) that has seen the world's largest cryptocurrency flirt with the $100K milestone.  Nvidia (NVDA) delivered quarterly revenue that nearly doubled Y/Y and data center revenue that climbed to a record ~$31B. However, the world's largest publicly listed company's current quarter revenue outlook came in lower than some of the loftiest expectations, and for investors used to an absolute blowout report that sent shares falling after hours on Wednesday. But the stock rebounded on Thursday and eventually ended higher, with analysts focusing on its exceptional numbers.  The story of the week was, no doubt, bitcoin (BTC-USD). The cryptocurrency staged what looked like an inevitable march to $100K, though that level still remains elusive at the time of writing, coming as close as ~$XXK (this bolded part has to be checked and edited as fit in the card). Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is fast cementing its place as one of the most prominent ""Trump trades"" following the Republican candidate's election victory.  For the week, the S&P (SP500) climbed +1.7%, while the Nasdaq Composite (COMP:IND) also added +1.7%. The Dow (DJI) gained +2.0%."

2024-11-26,Francis Benistant,Executive Director at Technology Modeling Automation,"hashtag #semiconductor  hashtag #technology  hashtag #engineering  hashtag #electronics  hashtag #vlsi  hashtag #chipmanufacturing  hashtag #euindustry  hashtag #legacychips  hashtag #semiconductorindustry  hashtag #techinnovation  The EU ambition to compete in advanced chip manufacturing has faced a significant setback, as industry experts now advocate for a focus on legacy semiconductor production instead. The ESIA, which includes major players like NXP, Nexperia, GlobalFoundries, and Intel, suggests that Europe should concentrate on mature chip processes rather than trying to compete with cutting-edge technology.  ## Current State of European Chip Manufacturing  European chip manufacturing has traditionally excelled in producing legacy chips using mature processes. Recent projects, such as the ESMC joint venture involving TSMC, Bosch, Siemens, and NXP, continue to focus on this area. These chips are based on older nodes that are no longer considered cutting-edge but still have significant applications.  For context, while TSMC's 28nm process was state-of-the-art in 2011, producing advanced CPUs, GPUs, and SoCs, it is now used for less complex chips. Meanwhile, companies like Apple and Nvidia have moved on to much more advanced 3-4 nanometer processes.  ## Shift in EU Chip Strategy  The ESIA has responded positively to the appointment of Henna Virkkunen as EU Commissioner-designate for the chip industry. Both the ESIA and Virkkunen advocate for emphasizing mature processes, such as 28nm, for legacy chip production. This approach aims to cater to the needs of the automotive and industrial sectors, which often rely on less advanced chip technologies.  This shift represents a return to the original intent of the EU Chips Act, which was initially conceived as a response to COVID-related supply chain issues. Over time, the act evolved to include ambitions of making Europe competitive with East Asia and the U.S. in advanced chip production. However, the dominance of non-European players like TSMC, Samsung, and Intel in cutting-edge chip manufacturing has made this goal increasingly unrealistic.  ## Implications for European Chip Industry  While focusing on legacy chip production aligns with Europe's current strengths, it also means that the continent may never achieve complete autonomy in its chip industry supply chain. Modern technologies, including software-driven vehicles, require a mix of legacy chips and advanced processors that are economical, fast, and versatile.  Despite these limitations, Europe maintains a strong position in the global chip industry through companies like Imec and ASML. This underscores the reality that the chip industry is inherently globalized, and while Europe has an important role to play, it cannot operate in isolation.  In conclusion, the EU's dream of building advanced chips has indeed faced significant challenges, leading to a more pragmatic approach focused on leveraging existing strengths in legacy chip production and maintaining a vital role in the global semiconductor value chain."

A Moore machine is a subclass of FSM in which output is dependent solely on the present state. This characteristic makes it deterministic, well-suited for uses where expected functionality is of great importance.  🎯 Even Parity Generator  The idea sounds simple but is significant: the number of 1s in the succeeded binary sequence must be preserved as even; this is achieved by adding the appropriate parity bit. Here’s the Moore machine approach towards the issue:  States: Indicates if the sequence has even number or odd number of 1s.  Transitions: Event Occurrences defined by one or zero input bits.  Output: The output value is decided by the existing state making it a parity output generator.  🌟 Applications  Generators of the parity type circuits like these are vital for the mechanisms of error detection and correction in data transfer and storage.

The reaction from investors has been marked by what's being termed as ""post-earnings blues."" This highlights a challenge we've seen become increasingly prevalent in the tech sector — short-term fluctuations that can overshadow long-term potential.  Additionally, with the backdrop of ongoing trade tensions, particularly with China, Nvidia's situation is further complicated. As a leader in graphics processing units and AI technologies, any shifts in trade policy directly impact their operations and strategic positioning. The question on many minds is: How will Nvidia navigate these challenges to continue driving growth and innovation?  For tech investors, understanding these nuances is crucial. Earnings reports are just one piece of the puzzle; broader market conditions and geopolitical factors come into play as well. Those investing in Nvidia or similar tech companies must stay informed and agile, keeping an eye on both corporate performance and external factors that may influence stock valuation.  As we evaluate Nvidia's path forward, let's also remember the long-term vision. The company is at the forefront of AI and gaming technology, and despite short-term setbacks, its foundational strengths remain robust. This is a reminder that tolerance for volatility can pay off in the long run in such innovative fields.  As we move forward, the tech industry will continue to face headwinds.

Yesterday it appeared in Geekbench a performance test of the Intel Arc B580 with a performance that should be taken with a grain of salt and that, at first, does not seem like a good option for the most demanding users. Intel launched the Intel Arc range two years ago at a lower than normal price compared to NVIDIA and amd and, even so, it didn’t go well at all.  With the Intel Arc B580 Battlemage, the guys at Intel want to follow the same pricing strategy and according to the latest leak, it will be priced at only $250.  Price of the Intel Arc B580 Battlemage Intel’s second attempt to position itself in the graphics card market dominated with an iron fist by NVIDIA and with AMD with a minimal part of the pie, seems to follow the same pricing strategy. This new generation uses Xe2-HPG architecture to improve not only performance but also efficiency and includes, of course, improved support for ray tracing. The success of the Intel Arc B580, as with any graphics card or processor, not only depends on a good pricing strategy, but also on its performance and what the drivers are capable of offering.    Intel Arc B580 Limited Edition Graphics Box31P06HB0BA735858549271$250😐  November 27, 2024 • 13:54     Once again, the source of this information comes from the X (Twitter) user momomo_us who has published various price screenshots from various websites. But, the most curious thing of all is that, as we can see in these images, there is talk of a limited edition. With that, we don’t know if it is a promotional launch version or if it is simply a commercial claim that is going nowhere. What do we know about the Intel Arc B580 The Intel Arc B580 will reach the mid-range market, it has 12 GB GDDR6 video memory and 20 Xe2 cores. This means 4 GB less memory and 4 cores than the previous generation, figures that should be compensated with the new architecture since, otherwise, it makes no sense for Intel to go down the path of efficiency instead of performance at the same time. What have you done with the new ones? Core Ultra 200 Series. Another aspect that also draws attention to this new generation of Intel graphics is that, for now, it seems that ASRock is the only manufacturer that wants to give Intel a new opportunity, at least based on the information we know so far. Regarding the release date, if we continue this pace of leaks, it is likely that tomorrow or at most Monday we will know.",0.543,NEGATIVE,1.0

Отказ от сотрудничества с Apple (2007): Intel отверг предложение Apple создать процессор для первого iPhone, посчитав проект недостаточно прибыльным. В итоге Apple выбрала ARM-архитектуру, которая стала стандартом для мобильных устройств, а Intel навсегда потерял этот рынок.  2. Отставание в производственных техпроцессах: Intel задержалась с внедрением 10-нм и 7-нм технологий, что позволило конкурентам, таким как TSMC и AMD, выйти вперед с более эффективными и производительными чипами.  3. Игнорирование рынка ИИ: Intel не сумела вовремя инвестировать в разработку специализированных решений для искусственного интеллекта (GPU, TPU). Это позволило Nvidia занять лидирующую позицию и доминировать в сегменте вычислений для ИИ.  Желаю всем нам гибкости ума, счастливой пятницы и удачного закрытия ноября!)",0.509,POSITIVE,0.992

All are American. None are European. Going a level down, Europe has four $100bn-plus tech companies compared to the US's 33.’  The main culprits? Excessive regulation, bureaucracy, and a dormant appetite for bold bets on revolutionary tech start-ups.  DeepMind is a prime example, amongst many others. It was acquired by Google for just £400m and is now valued in the tens of billions of pounds.  As highlighted in the 400-page Draghi report and today’s FT article: ‘Europe needs to celebrate and support experienced founders who are building and investing in the highest-risk, highest-reward ideas.’ There is an unequivocal need for bold and 'audacious' capital.  At, as a deep tech start-up, we’re playing our part by pushing the envelope of brain-computer interfaces and redefining the future of brain health.  The grand takeaway?

2024-11-30,Karun Thankachan,Senior Data Scientist @ Walmart (ex-Amazon) | DS/ML Mentor | RecSys Researcher | Inventor,"NVIDIA Data Science (DL Engineer) Interview Question: How do you choose between CBOW and Skip-gram architctures?  𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮𝘀𝗲𝘁 𝗦𝗶𝘇𝗲 Skip-Gram performs better with smaller datasets because it creates more training examples from each input sentence. For each word, it generates multiple context-word pairs, effectively increasing the amount of training data. CBOW, by averaging context words, benefits more from larger datasets where it has enough examples to learn robust representations.  𝗪𝗼𝗿𝗱 𝗙𝗿𝗲𝗾𝘂𝗲𝗻𝗰𝘆 Skip-Gram handles rare words better because it treats each context-target word pair as a separate training example, giving equal importance to rare and frequent words. CBOW, by averaging context words, tends to smooth over distributional information, leading to better representations for frequent words but potentially less accurate representations for rare words.  𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗶𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗦𝗽𝗲𝗲𝗱 CBOW typically trains faster because it predicts a single target word from multiple context words in one forward pass. Skip-Gram, conversely, predicts multiple context words for each target word, requiring more computations per training example.  𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗲𝘅𝘁 𝗪𝗶𝗻𝗱𝗼𝘄 𝗦𝗶𝘇𝗲 Skip-Gram can handle larger context windows more effectively because it directly models the relationship between each target word and its context words. CBOW, by averaging context words, may lose some of the nuanced relationships in larger contexts, making it more suitable for smaller window sizes.  𝗦𝗲𝗺𝗮𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝗖𝗮𝗽𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 Skip-Gram often captures semantic relationships better because it learns to predict each context word independently. This allows it to pick up on subtle semantic differences and relationships between words. CBOW, by averaging context, may miss some of these finer distinctions.  𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝘂𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗥𝗲𝘀𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗰𝗲𝘀 CBOW generally requires fewer parameters because it averages context word vectors before prediction, resulting in a smaller model size. Skip-Gram, predicting multiple context words, needs more parameters and thus more computational resources.  𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 your answer below!  𝗥𝗲𝗽𝗼𝘀𝘁 with comments to grow your own network!

Despite raising $11 billion and achieving a valuation of $50 billion, xAI faces challenges due to limited market penetration and $100 million in annual revenue compared to OpenAI's projected $4 billion.

It offers valuable knowledges on the business evolution of major tech companies, such as Google, Meta, Nvidia, DeepMind, and Spotify, from their startup phases. I agree with the author that access to capital is essential for start-ups, and experienced founders can do so much in this regard. Furthermore, ambitious start-ups with high growth potential have no limits as they are pioneers of the technological innovation. So, they require high-risk, long-term investments to drive breakthrough advancements. However, I believe that a comparison between the United States and Europe deserves a more nuanced analysis.  In my opinion, this is not only about regulations and lack of supporting experienced founders. The US has a vast domestic market and we attested many times that US government supports the US tech industry in order to accelerate the global market dominance. In contrast, Europe faces challenges in scaling companies due to a smaller national markets and more stringent regulations.

Het voorgestelde systeem maakt gebruik van robots die server racks verplaatsen en positioneren.  Een centraal stuurt de robots aan en past de configuratie van het datacenter dynamisch aan, afhankelijk van factoren zoals vraag naar rekenkracht, onderhoudsbehoeften en omgevingsomstandigheden.  Daarnaast houdt het monitoringsysteem de koelsystemen van datacenters in real-time in de gaten en optimaliseert het deze waar nodig. Dit zou het eenvoudiger maken om datacenters te schalen en aan te passen zonder dat menselijke technici continu nodig zijn.  Verder benadrukt Nvidia dat bij problemen die robots niet kunnen oplossen, een technicus wordt gewaarschuwd via een melding of alarm om de storing handmatig te onderzoeken.  Hoewel Nvidia zich op deze manier positioneert als innovator, is het onwaarschijnlijk dat het bedrijf zelf datacenters gaat bouwen of beheren.  Het huidige bedrijfsmodel, waarbij Nvidia technologie en chips levert aan andere partijen, is immers zeer succesvol. In het meest recente kwartaal rapporteerde het bedrijf een omzet van $35,08 miljard, een stijging van 94% ten opzichte van het voorgaande jaar.  Alleen al de inkomsten uit datacenters bedroegen $30,8 miljard, een groei van 112% op jaarbasis.  Door patenten zoals deze te ontwikkelen, kan Nvidia niet alleen licentieovereenkomsten en samenwerkingen aangaan, maar ook de toekomstige richting van datacenterontwikkeling vormgeven.  Op deze manier kan het bedrijf dus invloed uitoefenen op de bredere markt zonder zelf datacenters te hoeven bouwen.  Toch roept de introductie van robots in datacenters fundamentele vragen op: hoe ver moet automatisering gaan? En is het altijd wenselijk om menselijke tussenkomst volledig te elimineren?  Als een robot een server rack efficiënter kan verplaatsen dan een mens, wat is dan eigenlijk de rol van de mens. Is die rol er nog wel? Bovendien speelt de economische vraag mee: is het daadwerkelijk goedkoper om robots in te zetten?  .. lees meer op #",0.505,POSITIVE,0.991

2024-11-30,Catai,208 followers,"A inteligência artificial generativa, capaz de criar textos, imagens e outros conteúdos, tem revolucionado diversos setores. No entanto, sua ascensão tem sido acompanhada por uma série de controvérsias, especialmente no campo das artes e da cultura.  Um estudo recente, publicado por Alex Reisner na revista The Atlantic, revelou um dado alarmante: modelos de linguagem de grande porte (LLMs) foram treinados com mais de 139 mil diálogos de filmes e séries, incluindo clássicos como ""Os Simpsons"" e ""Breaking Bad"". Essa descoberta tem gerado um intenso debate sobre os direitos autorais e a ética no desenvolvimento da IA.  O material não foi retirado de roteiros oficiais, mas de legendas publicadas no site. Essas legendas, extraídas de DVDs, Blu-rays e streams online, servem como fonte por refletirem diálogos naturais, essenciais para ensinar chatbots a simular conversas. Essa prática, no entanto, envolve questões legais, já que legendas podem ser consideradas obras derivadas e protegidas por direitos autorais.  Empresas como Apple, Meta, Anthropic e Nvidia utilizaram essas legendas para treinar sistemas como Claude, OPT e NeMo Megatron. Além disso, organizações como Salesforce e Bloomberg criaram mais de 140 modelos de IA de código aberto com os mesmos dados, tudo sem permissão dos autores originais.  O OpenSubtitles oferece arquivos acessíveis a qualquer pessoa, mas com estrutura difícil de interpretar. O conjunto de dados, com 14 GB, inclui diálogos organizados em 446.612 arquivos, separados por IDs do IMDb. Reisner identificou cerca de 139 mil títulos únicos e mapeou informações como diretores e atores.  As empresas envolvidas não comentaram as acusações.

Resilience, vision, and work ethic are the foundations of personal and professional success. NVIDIA's CEO, Jensen Huang, exemplifies how these traits, when combined, fuel extraordinary accomplishments and sustain innovation.  Resilience involves more than recovering from setbacks; it is about adapting, learning, and emerging stronger. Huang underscores this by stating, ""Persistence and resilience are key to overcoming challenges and achieving success."" This perspective highlights the necessity of enduring difficulties to achieve meaningful growth.  Vision provides purpose and direction, guiding efforts to overcome obstacles. Huang articulates this by asserting, ""Success is a work in progress. It's not about achieving a goal; it's about constantly improving and pushing boundaries."" This mindset fosters innovation and drives individuals and organizations toward excellence.  Huang’s legendary work ethic has also been pivotal to his success. Known for his hands-on leadership, he actively engages in both technical and strategic aspects of NVIDIA's operations. His dedication is encapsulated in his remark, ""Excellence is the result of caring deeply and working tirelessly toward a vision."" Huang’s relentless pursuit of excellence sets an inspiring example, motivating those around him to push their limits.  Under Huang's leadership, NVIDIA transformed from a fledgling startup in 1993 into a global leader in graphics processing units and artificial intelligence. His ability to balance vision, resilience, and work ethic allowed NVIDIA to overcome intense competition and thrive in a rapidly evolving industry. Reflecting on this journey, Huang states, ""Our work is never done. This is a journey, not a destination,"" emphasizing the importance of continuous effort and innovation.  Moreover, Huang champions a culture that embraces challenges as opportunities. He notes, ""True innovation requires taking risks and being willing to fail,"" demonstrating that resilience is cultivated in environments where experimentation and learning from failure are encouraged.  In conclusion, the combination of resilience, vision, and work ethic is a powerful formula for overcoming challenges and achieving sustained success. Jensen Huang’s leadership at NVIDIA serves as a testament to these principles, offering a roadmap for anyone aspiring to excel. By embracing these qualities, individuals and organizations can navigate adversities, inspire others, and strive toward greatness.  Watch the short video:  Your thoughts!",0.513,POSITIVE,1.0

The US economy continues to pull ahead of its rivals.  📌Certain states rival entire nations  If California were a country, it would have a higher GDP than all the European nations, with the exception of Germany. 🚀  Texas and New York, meanwhile, would be positioned among the top 15 global economies.🌟  📍An irresistible innovation model  The USA concentrates the technological leaders: the Magnificent Seven: Apple, Microsoft, Tesla, Nvidia, Alphabet, Meta, Amazon.  📌 A dynamic, growing population  Unlike aging Europe, the US benefits from an increase in qualified immigrant workers, fueling its workforce and creativity.  The EU, on the other hand, is suffering from rapid aging, which is weighing down its competitiveness. 👶➡️👴  📍 A geopolitical force and a solid military  With a military budget that exceeds 800 billion dollars per year, the USA remains a dominant force, guaranteeing a favorable economic climate for investment. 🛡️💵  For comparison: The French military budget: 50 billion, more than 2 twice as low, per capita.  ▶️ And in 2023?  If current trends continue, U.S. GDP per capita could be twice as high as that of the European Union. 📊📉  🔻 What about Europe?

2024-11-30,Precious Ogunyanju,Full Stack Developer,"Elon Musk's artificial intelligence company, xAI, reportedly reached a valuation of $50 billion just 16 months after its founding in July 2023. It is now worth more than what the billionaire paid for Twitter. Arguably the most well-known name in the AI space, OpenAI, last valued at $157 billion, needed over nine years to achieve the same milestone. xAI is gaining traction in the competitive AI sector and is now valued higher than other AI startups, such as Anthropic (valued at $19 billion) and Perplexity (at $2.8 billion). xAI's journey has been marked by significant milestones, including raising $5 billion in its latest funding round to purchase 100,000 Nvidia chips. These chips will power the Memphis supercomputer, a facility designed to enhance the company's AI capabilities and support Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology. According to WSJ and other outlets, the funding included $5 billion from Valor Equity Partners, Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz and Qatar Investment Authority. The Memphis supercomputer, awaiting final approval, is a key part of xAI’s strategy. It was built in less time than is customary for projects of this kind and is situated on a former manufacturing site. In a recent podcast, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang mentioned that xAI finished building the supercluster in 19 days, although the procedure usually takes more than a year. “Just to put in perspective, 100,000 GPUs are easily the fastest supercomputer on the planet as one cluster. A supercomputer that you would build would normally take three years to plan,” Huang said, stressing the role of xAI's engineering and infrastructure teams and crediting them with the system's rapid deployment. xAI has most notably developed the AI chatbot Grok, inspired by the sci-fi novel The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Grok is positioned as a competitor to OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini and Anthropic's Claude. The chatbot uses xAI's proprietary large language model, Grok-2 and has been a notable part of the company's portfolio. Elon Musk has openly said that his social media platform, X, is being used to help train xAI's Grok chatbot. By tapping into the conversations and posts on X, the chatbot can learn to respond more naturally and relevantly. In just 16 months, xAI has achieved a notable valuation and infrastructure development within the industry. The company is preparing for further advancements with plans to double the number of AI chips at the Memphis facility.",0.549,POSITIVE,0.994

Unlike traditional scaling methods, the o1 model mimics human reasoning by breaking tasks into steps and using expert feedback.  This approach not only saves resources but also addresses challenges like skyrocketing costs and energy demands in AI model development.  💡 Why it Matters:  The innovative ""test-time compute"" technique lets AI allocate resources dynamically, boosting accuracy without excessive hardware.  For instance, a 20-second poker analysis delivered performance equivalent to scaling a model 100,000x longer!  🌍 Impact on the Industry:  With players like Google DeepMind and Anthropic adopting similar strategies, competition is intensifying.  Nvidia, a key AI chip supplier, may need to adapt as AI hardware demands shift, opening doors for new competitors.

2024-11-30,Gennaro Cuofano,Director of Sales EMEA at Pixis AI | Creator of The Business Engineer,"A reminder that Google has been among the top players into the accelerated computing space (pretty much what we call today an AI supercomputing system) with its TPU which is a chip (launched internally in 2015 and to the public in 2016), similar to the GPU but optimized since the onset for machine learning tasks. It’s pretty much the AI chip which powers up all Google’s AI efforts (e.g. Gemini). The latest Google’s iteration of the TPU is the v6e Trillium which is faster and more powerful than its previous version, with double the memory (32GB) and nearly 5x better performance for AI tasks. It connects more efficiently to servers, lowering costs for businesses using it.  This helps Google compete with NVIDIA in the AI hardware space!  It has: • More Memory: Doubled memory capacity to 32GB for faster processing. • Big Performance Boost: Nearly 5x better performance for AI tasks like machine learning. • Faster Connections: Improved server connections make data transfer quicker and smoother. • Lower Costs: Faster hardware helps businesses save on overall costs. • Competitive Edge: Keeps Google in the race with NVIDIA for top AI hardware.",0.532,POSITIVE,0.998

Despite some concerns around the two, U.S. equities eventually logged their second straight weekly gain, with the benchmark S&P 500 (SP500) ending at a record close.  Market participants got a taste of what is to come under Donald Trump's second administration, after the President-elect said he would levy 25% tariffs on goods coming from Mexico and Canada. He'll also look to charge an additional 10% tax on products from China, which would be above any additional tariffs.  A day before the Thanksgiving holiday, traders received a flurry of economic data. That included an unrevised updated estimate on U.S. Q3 GDP growth of 2.8%, and October's reading on the core personal consumption expenditures price index - widely seen as the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge. The data came in slightly hot, and showed that the Fed isn't out of the woods yet when it came to inflation.  The Fed's minutes of its November monetary policy committee meeting showed policymakers discussing the possibility of pausing rate cuts if inflation remains too elevated.  For the week, the S&P (SP500) climbed +1.1%, while the Nasdaq Composite (COMP:IND) also added +1.1%. The Dow (DJI) gained +1.4%.    Concrete Pumping (BBCP) Shares Are Too Cheap To Ignore.

2024-12-06,Marco Förster,ASEAN Director at Dezan Shira,"Vietnam was sad that Indonesia got the NVIDIA deal. Indonesia felt the same when VN got all that Apple investment. Plot twist: Now NVIDIA will go to VN, and Apple will go to ID. I coin it the Great Southeast Asian Tech Shuffle  In the high-stakes race for tech FDI, VN and ID are rewriting the playbook. Just as VN cemented its partnership with Apple to manufacture flagship products, ID secured a massive win with NVIDIA's plans for a regional AI data center earlier this year.  It seemed each nation had one-upped the other—until now. Apple has announced plans to invest $100 million in its first manufacturing plant in ID, aiming to comply with local content requirements and solidify its presence in SEA's largest economy.  Meanwhile, NVIDIA is set to (finally, after a lot of courting) open an AI research center in VN, tapping into the country's tech-savvy workforce and deepening its footprint in the region.  These moves highlight a broader strategy of diversification as global tech giants shift supply chains to multiple ASEAN countries. This comes in record speed, also in light of Trump 2.0.  The competition is fierce, but the ultimate winners might just be the people of both nations, benefiting from cutting-edge technologies and job creation.

The article implies that Taiwan Semiconductor is ready to roll out chips from its Chandler Arizona plant. If that is the case, it also leads one to conclude that Intel is falling behind in execution to realize its strategy. Both Taiwan Semi and Intel started to build their plants just around the same time and looks like Taiwan Semi is ahead. That could possibly explain why Intel's CEO quit. Given that chip fabrication plants are long gestation projects, Intel or for that matter any other semi-conductor manufacturer could face technology obsolesce risk, if these long gestation projects are further delayed.

News portals were reporting that India’s had been hacked. At first, he thought that meant a “technical glitch” and things would get back to normal. The full extent of his misfortune was yet to be revealed.  “My cousin told me some Rs 2,000 crore had been stolen from the company,” said the 32-year-old man. “I immediately rushed to withdraw my Rs 7 lakh investment on WazirX but it was too late--no transactions were allowed.”  The prospect of never being able to get his money back has caused sleeplessness, anxiety, emotional distress and setbacks in business. At home, he pretends nothing has happened. “My wife thinks I do some stock market trade,” he said. “She doesn’t understand crypto stuff--she thinks we are rich.”  He dwells on what might have been.  “Every day, I take a pen and paper (to calculate) and tell my co-worker that today the value of my crypto would have been Rs 25 lakh,” he said. “(Auto) agency guys would have given us so much business on such credit.”  About 15 million users of WazirX were victims of one of the largest cyberattacks on a cryptocurrency exchange in July, leading to the theft of investor holdings worth $235 million or nearly half of the platform's estimated reserves. Since then, the remaining funds on the platform have been frozen and trading has been halted.  Somewhere the thief (or thieves) who masterminded this heist is watching the tokens swell in value in the ongoing crypto bull run. As per an analysis of Lookonchain data, that $235 million will now be valued at about $330 million.  Crypto prices have skyrocketed in the past month following the victory of Donald Trump—a sceptic-turned-champion—in the US elections. In the past month, crypto market cap has grown from $2.4 trillion to $3.7 trillion, surpassing that of companies like Apple and Nvidia.  Netherlands-based blockchain intelligence firm Crystal Intelligence recently said that the WazirX thief has almost finished laundering the stolen funds via TornadoCash. Only $6 million of Ether (ETH) remains traceable. TornadoCash is an open source, non-custodial, fully decentralised cryptocurrency platform that shuffles crypto tokens, making it difficult to track the source of funds and recover any stolen money.",0.547,NEGATIVE,1.0

After the Corona disaster, graphics requirements increased due to web conferencing, online training, video playback, and the latest Office software, and the CPU load also increased. In 2022, the company added more servers and distributed virtual machines, but the situation did not improve and business efficiency remained low.  Since VDI did not provide satisfactory performance, the company was considering quitting VDI and migrating to physical PCs.  However, since data would remain on the physical PCs, the level of security was reduced and concerns remained.  <JSOL comment> We received a proposal to only enhance vCPUs from 2 vCPUs to 4 vCPUs, but we were worried. We received a proposal from another vendor to use NVIDIA's virtual GPU, saying, 'It would be better to enhance graphics performance without doubling the CPU,' which solved the problem. We received a proposal that we could 'increase the capacity ratio of virtual machines and reduce the number of servers' and 'improve performance by reducing CPU load while keeping costs down,' and we implemented the system after conducting actual testing.

𝐖𝐡𝐲 𝐕𝐢𝐞𝐭𝐧𝐚𝐦? If we look at the global technology map, it’s clear that semiconductors and AI are at the heart of the race for the future. While established centers like the U.S., Taiwan, and South Korea still dominate, the world’s supply chain is shifting — and Vietnam is emerging as a promising new piece of the puzzle.  👉 Here’s why NVIDIA’s choice makes sense: 1️⃣ : Positioned at the heart of Southeast Asia, Vietnam serves as a critical gateway to major markets across Asia-Pacific. 2️⃣ Rich : Vietnam ranks second globally for rare earth reserves — a vital component in semiconductor manufacturing. 3️⃣ : Proactive policies and incentives are fostering a robust, innovation-friendly investment climate. As Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh said: “We aim to not only conquer AI but also turn the sun, the wind, and the waves into clean energy for the future.” 4️⃣ Skilled development: Vietnam is actively building a strong pipeline of skilled tech talent, investing heavily in education and upskilling to meet the demands of the semiconductor and AI industries.  NVIDIA recognizes this opportunity. And they’re not alone. , , , and now NVIDIA — some of the world’s biggest players are placing their trust in Vietnam.  📌 But to me, the most significant reason lies in the . With over two decades in the tech industry, I’ve worked with engineering teams across the globe. Yet, I see something unique in Vietnamese engineers: - A relentless passion to innovate and contribute. - A deep determination to overcome barriers in an industry as competitive as semiconductors and AI. This spirit makes all the difference. It’s not something that can be measured — but it’s something you can feel when you work with us.  I believe NVIDIA’s decision marks just the beginning — a powerful start to a journey that will redefine the role Vietnam plays in AI, semiconductors, and global innovation.  Vietnam is ready.

2024-12-13,Barney Geerligs,On the retraining train,"cont'd 2 of 2 The data pyramid is one of three key principles underpinning work on GR00T.  Moravecs paradox states that machines struggle to perform at things humans find easy.  Team GR00T believes training data is the key to overcoming Moravec. However, the  exabytes of text and video data available to existing models, while  useful base  information, is inadequate for robots to learn proprioception and motor skills.  The pyramid needs to be built out with real robot training data – high value but limited due to time constraints and supplemented with more copious robot simulation data.  Here NVIDIA has been able to utilise clever tools and its titanic compute resource to simulate massive amounts of data in an environment called Omniverse. The importance of simulation is the backbone of the second “Matrix principle”. Generative AI  can create a multiplier effect from a few human based examples to thousands of virtual actions and in different environments, like climbing a flight of stairs.  Agents can then optimise this data in two learning paradigms. Reinforcement learning is an effective method for learning those intuitive motor actions we don’t even think about, rebalancing after a stumble, for example. Those thousands of simulations can also be used in imitation learning, to best mimic human manipulation of various objects and tasks, such as making a cup of coffee. The final core principle is the foundation agent – the idea that one neural network can be used for all humanoid robots, despite physical design differences, for all tasks. Again, mass simulation is what enables putting this principle into practice.   Interestingly the project team found GPT highly proficient at creating and optimising  Python code reward functions for the agent, including very complex actions such as spinning a pen through the fingers of one hand.  Tens of thousands of simulations of an action may not exactly represent the real world, but if generalisation holds the model will be able to learn the nth + 1 simulation in the real world.",0.518,POSITIVE,0.982

2024-12-13,Barney Geerligs,On the retraining train,"1 of 2 Agents and models - we’re not talking Bond movies here, rather agentic applications using large language models (LLMs). In tandem, these two hot topics offer us all the pinky promise and furrowed-brow worry of increasing automation and autonomous decision making, based primarily on natural language prompting. If you are curious about this burgeoning area, I can thoroughly recommend the free  LLM and Agents course currently offered by UC Berkeley RDI. Things I really like about the course (apart from being a freebie) ·       An “AI A-list” of weekly guest speakers kindly sharing their knowledge and practical experience and insights into the sprawling and rapidly developing field of agentic AI ·       Optionality around participation – pop in to a recorded guest lecture or go for full ninja certification by completing quizzes, labs and hackathon. ·       Engaging content, including fun real-world labs that require a basic level of Python understanding. Now, in the interests of full disclosure, one of the course requirements is to summarise and post one of the guest speaker’s lectures. I’ll go with Jim Fan’s fascinating presentation of his team’s work into robotics at NVIDIA. The moonshot ambition is to build a foundational model (cutely named GR00T)  for humanoid robots, creating an embodied AI brain enabling robots to perceive, react and perform actions as we do. The scale of the challenge is immense, dwarfing the size and complexity of LLMs, such as ChatGPT. Why make robots in our own image, when specialised robots may perform specific tasks better? One aspect is social, we feel more comfortable in the presence of machines like us.  Another reason is practical, our built environments are purposed for our human form, so humanoid robots will fit in well.  Of course, money is a key motivator too, the economic opportunity of a humanoid workforce is revolutionary.  The risk of ensuing  mass unemployment is a definite worry point for us biological humans, although, breezily,  Jim Fan skips this threat. GR00T aims to be a “specialised generalist” – providing the foundation for humanoid robots to become domain experts. Jim Fan draws the analogy of an LLM becoming special purpose (in coding, for example) after prompting, distillation and finetuning.  He maintains that history is on the side of the specialised generalist, being in the long run, cheaper and easier to maintain than an array of specialist applications, each with their own production pipeline.",0.514,POSITIVE,0.998
