2024-12-03,"Oluwole Ojewale, Ph.D",Regional Coordinator- Central Africa at Institute for Security Studies,"Publication alert üîî   I am very pleased to share my latest paper published by the.  Non-state armed groups pose direct challenges to the character of states and strategic balancing of security in international relations. The existence of such actors has been a serious security problem in the Sahel for over a decade. Recently, their activities have been described as banditry‚àí a composite crime manifesting in wanton killing, kidnapping for ransom, levying of illegal tax on farming communities, sexual violence, trafficking of arms and cattle rustling.  Banditry continues to pose a significant security challenge in southwest Niger and northwest Nigeria, with its dynamics and trends undergoing constant evolution. Recent studies are largely concentrated on Nigeria‚Äôs northwest, and focus largely on the criminal economy of kidnapping for ransom and civilian onslaught by bandits.  Recent advances in their pursuit of violence pose challenges to local and regional stability in West Africa, international security, the rule of law, human rights, and socioeconomic development. Therefore, the study endeavours to answer pertinent research questions.  What are the dynamics of cattle rustling in the contiguous border regions of southwest Niger and northwest Nigeria? What role does the proximity of international borders play in facilitating cattle rustling activities? How do cross-border ethnic or tribal ties impact the dynamics of cattle rustling? Through empirical research, this study seeks to understand the internationalisation of cattle rustling and how it is shaped by multiple factors in the contiguous border regions of southwest Niger and northwest Nigeria.  50 free online copies of the paper can be accessed via the link belowüëá",0.5092,POSITIVE,0.9704

2024-12-03,Zeynep Burcu Yenipinar,Female Founder | Advisor & Growth Professional | Digital Marketing Enthusiast | Sustainability and Clean Energy Supporter | Passionate Startup Builder | Branding Expert | Athlete,"Elon Musk Sues OpenAI Over Its Shift to For-Profit Status  Elon Musk has escalated his legal battle with OpenAI, filing a lawsuit to block the organization‚Äôs transition to a for-profit entity. Musk argues that this shift not only violates legal boundaries but also positions OpenAI‚Äîand its flagship product, ChatGPT‚Äîas a dominant force in artificial intelligence, potentially edging out competitors, including his own AI venture, xAI.  At the core of Musk‚Äôs complaint is the claim that OpenAI, led by CEO Sam Altman, has drifted away from its founding mission as a nonprofit dedicated to using AI for the common good. Musk points to OpenAI‚Äôs acceptance of significant funding fromin 2019 as a turning point, alleging that financial interests have overshadowed the organization‚Äôs original purpose. Musk‚Äôs legal team accuses OpenAI of engaging in monopolistic practices, arguing that the company, influenced by Microsoft and Altman, has violated federal antitrust laws. These alleged practices, according to Musk, include limiting funding opportunities for emerging AI startups, effectively stifling competition.  , however, has dismissed Musk‚Äôs claims, stating that his lawsuit lacks merit. The company emphasizes its commitment to innovation and transparency, despite the ongoing legal battle. This marks Musk‚Äôs third attempt to challenge OpenAI‚Äôs for-profit shift, following a withdrawn lawsuit in California state court and a subsequent refiling in federal court. In addition to seeking an injunction to halt OpenAI‚Äôs restructuring, Musk aims to prevent the company from entering exclusive agreements with investors that he views as anti-competitive. Meanwhile, Musk continues to grow xAI, his own AI venture, which has seen rapid valuation growth since its launch in 2023. The debate over OpenAI‚Äôs transition raises larger questions about whether the organization can remain true to its mission of serving the public good. While OpenAI has secured significant funding under its new structure, board chairman Bret Taylor has reassured stakeholders that the nonprofit arm will retain a meaningful role and a substantial stake in the company.  This hybrid approach was designed to address rising costs in AI development. However, the transition hasn‚Äôt been without controversy. Tensions over balancing profit-making with AI safety came to a head in 2023 with the temporary removal and eventual reinstatement of CEO Sam Altman, highlighting the internal struggles that accompany OpenAI‚Äôs evolving role in the tech world. This lawsuit adds another layer of complexity to the ongoing conversation about the future of AI development and the ethics of balancing , , and public interest.

Here are some things to watch out for:  - Lack of Preparation: Not researching the company or role can make you appear uninterested. Always take the time to understand the company‚Äôs mission, values, and what the role requires.  - Arriving Late: Being late to an interview, even by a few minutes, sends the wrong message. It shows poor time management and disrespect for the interviewer‚Äôs time. Aim to arrive early and be prepared.  - Inadequate Body Language: Poor posture, avoiding eye contact, or crossing your arms can make you seem uninterested or unconfident. Positive body language like a firm handshake and good posture can leave a great impression.  - Over-talking or Under-talking: Giving overly long answers or being too brief can be detrimental. It's important to strike a balance‚Äîanswer the question thoughtfully, but stay concise and to the point.  - Speaking Negatively About Past Employers: Even if you had a bad experience at your previous job, avoid bad-mouthing employers or colleagues.

2024-12-03,Rohini Anand PhD,Strategic DEI Advisor | Highly Sought-after Board Member | Published Author | Esteemed Speaker,"‚ÄúI‚Äôve had a wonderful life,‚Äù is how John D. Kemp, author of Disability Friendly and President and CEO of Lakeshore Foundation, started his conversation with me. Born missing most of his arms and legs and losing his mother when he was 15 months, John Kemp‚Äôs is a remarkable story of courage and resilience. A story that led him to play a key role as a disability advocate on the national and international stage.  Today on International Day of People with Disabilities, in his book John Kemp reminds us that people with disabilities make up at least 15% of the global population ‚Äì more than 1 billion people- and are an underutilized talent pool. He provides us with a blueprint that organizations can use to make their workplaces disability friendly so that they can recruit and retain people with disabilities. Disability friendly workplaces make for enhanced innovation, team work and productivity that benefit all.  In my conversations with John, he credits his father who lost his wife - the love of his life- at 32 years and dedicated his life to fulfil John‚Äôs mother‚Äôs wish that John be given every opportunity in life. His father always encouraged him to do whatever he wanted including John‚Äôs childhood aspiration to be a baseball star. And he conditioned John to be independent ‚Äì just as he did with John‚Äôs siblings. John described vividly his seven block walk to grade school in N Dakota in 20 degree below freezing weather and 2 feet of snow.  In addition to a roadmap for organizations to build an inclusive culture for people with disabilities, John narrates his lived experience with candor and humor. He became a student manager of a basketball team so he could vicariously fulfil his dream and went on to law school and was co-founder of the American association of People with Disabilities (AAPD).  John Kemp closed his conversation with me by quoting his father saying that everyone in the school will benefit by John being in their classroom- a great analogy for workplaces where entire teams benefit from the presence and inclusion of people with disabilities.  This International Day of People with Disabilities, I encourage you to be a disability ally and to read John‚Äôs book.

Most companies take a top down, arms length approach to community engagement.  Rather than stopping, talking and listening to what a community needs.backed this up with the action thatemployees took recently to save a river in the Balkans.

His words cut through the noise of modern distractions, offering a stark critique of how far we‚Äôve drifted from the ideals of service, sacrifice, and steadfast leadership that once defined America.  Our generation, as Flynn notes, has too often chosen comfort over courage, consumerism over contribution, and feelings over principles.  We lament the lack of inspiring leaders, yet fail to foster the conditions for such leaders to emerge. Instead, we elect those who soothe rather than challenge us‚Äîleaders driven by optics, not by moral conviction or a commitment to enduring greatness.  Flynn‚Äôs call underscores a deeper truth: the erosion of our foundational institutions is not solely the fault of politicians or bureaucracies. It reflects our collective inaction. By prioritizing self-interest over service, we have allowed the very pillars of our republic to falter.  However, hope remains. As Flynn points out, we are blessed with an opportunity to reclaim our position as a beacon of freedom and strength. True leaders must rise‚Äîthose willing to take risks, stand firm on principle, and endure the trials necessary to secure a better future. But this requires more than words; it demands participation, sacrifice, and a commitment to teaching our children how to think critically and uphold enduring values.  This is a generational call to arms‚Äînot of war, but of renewal.  We must seize this moment to restore America‚Äôs greatness, not through empty rhetoric but through action, faith, and a recommitment to what it truly means to lead the free world.

2024-12-03,Yena Zhan,"Senior HR Director, Greater China","As we celebrate the International Day of Persons with Disability today, I want to share my recent experience with a temporary disability.  A few months ago, I broke my right arm, leaving my dominant hand and arm with limited functionality for about three months. This experience has given me valuable reflections in many ways.  Firstly, technology has been a game-changer. Despite my limitations, my work efficiency remained unaffected. My colleagues were amazed at how swiftly I could respond using just my left hand. When I revealed that our laptops have a voice input function in any language, they were astonished. I, too, was pleasantly surprised when I reached out to the Accenture Access Support Center and discovered that this feature was already available on all our laptops.  Secondly, an inclusive culture makes a world of difference. I was scheduled to facilitate a virtual global leadership program in October, but I felt overwhelmed by the preparation and facilitation required with just one hand. When I informed the faculty committee about my situation, they responded with understanding and care. This support made me even more committed to contributing after I recover. It showcases how inclusiveness boosts employee engagement.  Lastly, disability can unleash hidden potentials. I found myself putting contact lenses in with one hand and gaining a newfound curiosity for technologies that enhance accessibility.  If there is loss, there is also gain. This experience reminds us to embrace differences, uncover and support the unique talents of people with disabilities with technology and create an environment where their strengths are celebrated!",0.5212,POSITIVE,0.9997

Com Finance","TAXATION AND VOTING  Many people do not participate in things they don't identify with nor do they own what they do not contribute towards. In the recent past months, we have seen the white collar workers/salaried workers up in arms over taxation and the additional deductions in the payslip. This has resulted to more people engaging in public participation processes for various legislations and they now strongly feel they have a say on how the government is run and taxes are spent. Iam certain that there will be a sharp increase on the number of voters who will participate in the coming elections from that demographic. Next the government should expand the tax base without discrimination.(whoever will hack taxing the informal sector will be God sent,it will ensure the formal sector doesn't bear the burden of taxation and paying of some statutory deductions like housing levy and SHIF)I call it a burden because most people in the informal sector may be doing their annual tax returns but grossly understating their tax due, while a very big percentage does not do any tax returns whatsoever. When everyone(and by everyone i mean everyone who has an income generating activity) pays income tax, then no one will take 100 bob during election day and fail to vote, because we will all be stakeholders in this nation. We will all feel entitled to have a say on how our taxes are spent and the ballot will be our only saviour.Implementing this may seem difficult but it's the only way to ensure that we all equitably contribute to the development of our nation and it will be a blessing in disguise as people will be careful with the leaders they vote for, we will vote logically not emotionally.",0.5116,POSITIVE,0.78

From all the languages I've worked with for the last decade (Python, Javascript, C, C++, Odin, Zig, OCaml), nothing even comes close to the joy that you get while coding in Rust ü¶Ä  It's the mix of everything:  - incredible core language tooling - a compiler that guides you - you can express all the states of your program in the type system - amazing ecosystem of available crates - vibe and the attitude of people that develop open source things in Rust ü¶Ä (yes, they're quite different vs. those that mainly develop in C or C++ btw, at least in my experience) - you can go as low - or high - level as you want - you can build your program for virtually any platform out there, including web - how easy it is to build highly advanced CLI tools - the macro system that allows you to build any DSL that you want - how easy it is to jump into massive Rust ü¶Ä codebases and push PRs day 1 without fearing that you'll break the entire thing - the fact that so many more smart people are joining the ecosystem and help to improve everything, including Rust ü¶Ä itself  I could go on and on...

2024-12-03,James Spencer MPhil MBCI,Global Political Violence Risk Consultant at AIG,"If this account is accurate, it will do little to help restore the Police's reputation.   Swansea mother ‚Äòtraumatised‚Äô by arrest under Terrorism Act Haroon Siddique 2 Dec 2024  A Swansea woman has said she was left traumatised after being arrested under the Terrorism Act and held incommunicado for 5 days because her daughter was allegedly involved in an action against an Israeli arms company. Emma Kamio, 57, who runs her own homeopathy and pilates business, was led away in handcuffs from her home in front of her son and neighbours and had three laptops and mobile phones seized, after a Palestine Action protest at an Elbit Systems UK building near Patchway on the outskirts of Bristol. She was so traumatised by the incident in August that she has only recently been able to talk about it. Kamio said she was denied a duty solicitor for the first 2 days, and when she was transferred into the custody of counter-terrorism police she was held in a filthy cell, was searched repeatedly and the lights were left on all night, which she described it as ‚Äúpsychological torture‚Äù. The former nurse, who also has a younger daughter aged 16, said: ‚ÄúI disappeared from my family for 5 days due to the abuse of the Terrorism Act. [...] Kamio said she was initially taken to Swansea police station on 6 August and then to Bristol. She said her daughter Leona, 29, who lives in London, was brought from a different police station in Bristol and both were put in cages in the back of van, from which they could not see each other, for a high-speed blue-lights journey. [...] She said the cell in Newbury that she was initially placed in for 2 days had ‚Äúthe last occupant‚Äôs old dried faeces encrusted around the toilet‚Äù, and she was searched every time she left the cell (as was the cell) and again when she re-entered. Kamio spent her time in custody worrying about her family, her clients and the impact on her business, which she had struggled to rebuild after the coronavirus pandemic. [...] Kamio said police had not returned the electronic devices ‚Äì only one of which, a laptop, belonged to Leona ‚Äì her clothes and expensive sandals she was wearing when arrested, or her jewellery, including platinum earrings her late mother had had made for her. South Wales police said a complaint against officers was being investigated. Counter Terrorism Policing South East said Kamio was ‚Äúheld in conjunction with the relevant legislation and codes of practice for arrest and detention whilst in custody‚Äù. Thames Valley police said their cells were cleaned regularly and any concerns raised were addressed. Leona Kamio has been charged with criminal damage, violent disorder and aggravated burglary in relation to the protest, which the Crown Prosecution Service said had a ‚Äúterrorist connection‚Äù. They are not offences under the Terrorism Act. In total, 18 people have been charged in relation to the 6 August incident.",0.5467,NEGATIVE,0.9992

2024-12-03,Marcin ≈ªyrkowski,"Principal Engineer & Co-Founder at Tronel | Embedded Solutions for IoT, Automation & Industrial Manufacturing ‚öôÔ∏è | Driving Innovation in High-Tech Industries üåê","Is RTOS really just for engineers?  If you hear the term RTOS (Real-Time Operating System) and think it's just another technical jargon, well‚Ä¶ you're right. But it‚Äôs also a game-changer in industries like automotive and automation, redefining how the modern world works.  An example? Imagine a driver assistance system (ADAS) that has to detect an obstacle and react before you have time to press the brake. Or a production line where a robotic arm stops in a split second to avoid a collision. In both cases, there is no room for delays ‚Äì and that's where RTOS comes in.  RTOS differs from ordinary operating systems in that it operates deterministically. What does that mean? It means that every task is executed at a predictable time ‚Äì always. It's like an orchestra, where a conductor ensures that every musician plays precisely at the right time. Without the conductor, we'd have chaos; without RTOS, we'd have systems that fail where precision matters.  At Tronel, we've been working with RTOS for years, designing systems that must operate in conditions where reliability and timing are non-negotiable. How do we use RTOS?  üîπ Minimize response time: In embedded systems, every millisecond matters. üîπ Prioritize tasks: Because brake response is more important than radio startup. üîπ Optimize resources: With an RTOS, even hardware with limited power runs at full capacity.  As a result, we create solutions for industries such as automotive and automation that work whenever they need to.  So, is RTOS something only engineers should care about? Personally, I don‚Äôt think so.  Its impact is everywhere, from the cars we drive to the production lines that build them. If you‚Äôve worked with RTOS ‚Äì or are curious about how it might help your project ‚Äì I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts. Let‚Äôs discuss!",0.5184,POSITIVE,0.9971

Die Unterstellung:  Meine schnelle Reaktion sei unpers√∂nlich und weil offensichtlich die Antwort mit ChatPGT erstellt wurde, schenkt der Kunde meiner Kompetenz weniger Glaube.  Meine Antwort darauf - ganz n√ºchtern und ohne Scham:  ""Ich entschuldige mich nicht daf√ºr, Technologie zu nutzen, um effizient zu sein. Der Inhalt meiner E-Mail ist echt und inhaltlich korrekt, denn die KI antwortet basiert auf meiner 15-j√§hriges Brand Expertise. Wir sind eine der f√ºhrenden PR Agenturen, weil wir mehr k√∂nnen als manuell eine E-Mail zu verfassen.""  Wann ich das so mache mit KI und E-Mail?  Immer, √ºberall üòÇ - das Foto ist ein echtes Beispiel: üëâ Ehemannhat Flugstunde mit Kind 1 auf dem Arm und ich bin als Supporterin aka Chauffeurin nur physisch anwesend und beantworte halt nebenbei fix E-Mails.  Zwischen Familie, Business und dem echten Leben drau√üen, beantworte ich meine Inbox gerne mal mithilfe von Diktierfunktion und ChatGPT. Eine cleane E-Mail Inbox stresst mich weniger und ich weigere mich meine Zeit zu verschwenden eine E-Mail hundert Mal quer lesen zwecks Korrektheit. KI macht mich entspannter.  Zumal ich zwar starke Rechtschreib- und Grammatikskills besitze (Deutsch Abitur 14 Punkte, ü§ì), aber ich leide an einer Krankheit, sodass mein Hirn einzelne W√∂rter verschluckt, weil es zu schnell denkt und liest. KI l√§sst mich weniger dumm wirken.  KI ist f√ºr mich ein Werkzeug, kein Ersatz.  Sie hilft bei Details wie Rechtschreibung und Formulierungen, w√§hrend ich mich auf die Qualit√§t und Strategie konzentriere. Sie hilft mir schnell zu sein, sie hilft mir die freigewordene Zeit in einen Anruf zu investieren, um f√ºr meinen PR Kunden eine geile einzigartige Idee zu starten. Eine Idee, die einzigartig in meinem Brain entsteht, die KI oder eine andere Agentur nicht einfach umsetzen k√∂nnen.  Um Missverst√§ndnisse zu vermeiden, habe ich meine Signatur jetzt angepasst:  ùë∫ùíÜùíèùíï ùíÉùíö ùíäùë∑ùíâùíêùíèùíÜ, ùíïùíöùíëùíÜùíÖ ùíòùíäùíïùíâ ùíïùíâùíñùíéùíÉùíî. ùë™ùíìùíÜùíÇùíïùíäùíêùíè ùíîùíñùíëùíëùíêùíìùíïùíÜùíÖ ùíÉùíö ùë®ùë∞, ùíéùíÜùíîùíîùíÇùíàùíÜ ùíñùíèùíáùíäùíçùíïùíÜùíìùíÜùíÖ‚ÄîùíëùíçùíÜùíÇùíîùíÜ ùíÜùíôùíÑùíñùíîùíÜ ùíïùíöùíëùíêùíî!

Uns gegenseitig vorwerfen KI einzusetzen und dadurch inkompetenter zu sein, finde ich deplatziert.

Is there a developing issue with some versions of the federated model? Spreading risk, allowing local and diversified funding, multiple T&F grants, and sharing expertise, as well as brand recognition, are seen to be the benefits: all good.  But in some ways the overheads problem gets magnified. Each of these federated local organisations has its own overheads anyway. Then you have another massive overhead.  The expertise the centre brings - and certainly any funding - can be limited, and many local organisations complain that they simply don‚Äôt know what the centre does except give them branding guidelines and ask for reports. (Not all - some federations I know work very well.)  And then you have a sort of centralised head without a body. You have central costs writ-large with comparatively limited ways to apportion those costs. You may look at making local branches contribute to those, but that tends not to be popular.  Taking on some contracts directly for the ‚Äòhead‚Äô (ie centre) and looking for grants may help, but trusts funding goes to delivery and they don‚Äôt like core costs even at delivery level. Local contracts are where most remaining public sector money is (if any) and you‚Äôre less likely to get them because you‚Äôre not local and you don‚Äôt want to compete with your branches.  Of course they mostly surivive on individual donations, but with those going down like a knackered lift, that has to be more and more difficult - and the other options are so much less available.  I hope Relate can pull it together, but sadly I fear that this is a trend and we will see other franchises‚Äô centres go. Of course that then hugely damages the infrastructure the sector needs again.  And finally, staff not getting redundancy. FFS get it together people. NOT OKAY.

The post was heavily fortified and mined.  When 14 Guards reached the post, they were subjected to intense shelling and small arms fire by the enemy.

If your arm span is considerably smaller than your height, it could indicate a different body structure or potential developmental issues.  For most people, their arm span is very close to their height, meaning the ratio is around 1:1.  To accurately assess your arm span to height ratio, make sure to measure correctly by fully extending your arms out to the side at shoulder level while standing with your feet together.

Now that December has arrived, I thought it might be time to reflect before the new year begins.  In February I spent 2 weeks withon an educational trip, where I learned that despite language barriers, a smile can be understood anywhere. As strangers became friends, they welcomed us into their homes, shared their stories, and taught me the power of listening. I also discovered that engineering doesn't always mean mechanical or electrical solutions. Have you heard of? They train Magawa rats to sniff out landmines to save live! Pretty ingenious.  Then it was back to university, where I completed my favourite course yet with a team of 5. We built a robot with an extending arm and rotating base to pick up six tennis balls from various locations and heights. This challenge taught me that not knowing the answer often means you are about to do something pretty fun.  and, though vastly different in their goals‚Äîone raising suicide awareness, the other exploring the intersection of neurology, consciousness and technology‚Äîare two volunteer organisations I am incredibly proud to be a part of. What I‚Äôve learned from both is honestly too much to put into words here. Maybe we should all volunteer a little more often :)  Next... A my largest mountain yet‚Äînot mentally but physically. Mt Fugi from base to top and back down again. I climbed Mount Fuji from base to summit and back down again. I learned that my mind might be weak, but my legs are strong.

Last week, I was at the NPF State CID, Osogbo, to receive a package.  As I walked towards the entrance, I had no idea that a simple errand would turn into a teachable moment. My contact, a sister and an officer, had promised to meet me at the entrance, so I waited patiently beside a small shelter close to the entrance.  Before long, a chorus of catcalls echoed from the officers stationed at the corner. 'Ehsss, leave that place, Oga dey call you,' one of them jeered. I turned, my anger simmering just below the surface. ""Oga, you wouldn't appreciate it if I referred to you as ""Ehh man...""' I retorted, my voice firm but respectful.   The officer (The Oga), taken aback by my assertiveness, beckoned me over and asked why I was angry.  'Oga, your men can do better. You can do better. The fact that you have your uniform on doesn't make you a superior human. Respect is reciprocal"" I said firmly.  The officer nodded, taking my words to heart. He observed that I may have some relationship with an officer (because of how bold I was), so he apologized and asked for my mission in their base. Just then, my contact emerged, sensing the tension in the air. 'What happened?' she asked, her eyes scanning the scene. I downplayed the incident, but she wasn't satisfied. She asked her colleagues what had transpired, but they also (knowing what they did) dismissed the issue.  Probably knowing what her male colleagues are capable of doing, she decided to reveal my identity. 'That's Evelyn Ohiolei of RaveFM,' she announced proudly.  The atmosphere shifted instantly. The officers' demeanor changed from dismissive to deferential. 'Oh... so na she be this... I no know say you fine like this oo..' one of them exclaimed. I smiled, nodded, and collected my package.  As I walked away from the heavily guarded entrance, I couldn't help but overhear the officers' newfound respect for me. 'All these journalists sef...' one of them trailed off, their tone now laced with admiration. It was a small victory, but one that reminded me that, always I must stand up for myself and that respect is indeed reciprocal.  That may not be the case of another random lady who may be intimidated by the officer's uniform, baritone voices and arms. I hope our officers can understand that, citizens must be treated with respect and dignity.   Evelyn Ohiolei",0.5126,NEGATIVE,0.9665

Here are some highlights and lessons from my year:  üíª Starting the Year with Tecktick I kicked off 2024 as a Software Developer at Tecktick, diving into exciting projects that pushed me to refine my skills and deliver impactful solutions. This experience was pivotal in building my confidence and strengthening my foundation in software development.  üéì Transitioning to IT Support Mid-year, I embraced a new challenge as an IT Support Intern. It‚Äôs been a hands-on learning experience, from understanding infrastructure support and asset management to exploring the world of networking. Each day presents opportunities to grow, and I‚Äôve been lucky to work alongside an amazing team that makes learning even more fulfilling.  üöß Tackling Challenges in the Tech Industry The tech industry is fast-paced and demanding, and I‚Äôve certainly felt the weight of imposter syndrome at times. From questioning whether I belong to doubting my capabilities, there were moments of self-doubt. But through perseverance, mentorship, and leaning on my support system, I‚Äôve learned to recognize my worth and trust in my ability to learn and grow.  üìö Leveraging Resources for Growth Platforms like W3Schools, Scrimba, freeCodeCamp, and Coursera have been my constant companions this year. They‚Äôve helped me stay curious, upskill, and stay relevant in an ever-evolving tech landscape.  üöÄ A Big Decision One of the defining moments of my year was being offered a CTO role at a startup. While I was deeply honored by the opportunity, I chose to turn it down‚Äîfor now. I realized I still have so much to learn and experience before stepping into such a significant leadership position. For me, growth and preparation are key, and I‚Äôm excited to continue building the skills and knowledge that will one day make me ready for such a challenge.  üåü Looking Ahead to 2025 With just over a month to go, I‚Äôm excited to welcome 2025 with open arms. My goals include continuing to sharpen my skills, contributing to meaningful projects, and finding new ways to give back to the tech community.  To everyone who has been part of my journey this year‚Äîthank you. Your support, encouragement, and collaboration have made all the difference. Here‚Äôs to finishing 2024 strong and stepping boldly into a new year full of possibilities.  How has your year been? What are you looking forward to in 2025?

2024-12-03,Rohini Anand PhD,Strategic DEI Advisor | Highly Sought-after Board Member | Published Author | Esteemed Speaker,"‚ÄúI‚Äôve had a wonderful life,‚Äù is how John D. Kemp, author of Disability Friendly and President and CEO of Lakeshore Foundation, started his conversation with me. Born missing most of his arms and legs and losing his mother when he was 15 months, John Kemp‚Äôs is a remarkable story of courage and resilience. A story that led him to play a key role as a disability advocate on the national and international stage.  Today on International Day of People with Disabilities, in his book John Kemp reminds us that people with disabilities make up at least 15% of the global population ‚Äì more than 1 billion people- and are an underutilized talent pool. He provides us with a blueprint that organizations can use to make their workplaces disability friendly so that they can recruit and retain people with disabilities. Disability friendly workplaces make for enhanced innovation, team work and productivity that benefit all.  In my conversations with John, he credits his father who lost his wife - the love of his life- at 32 years and dedicated his life to fulfil John‚Äôs mother‚Äôs wish that John be given every opportunity in life. His father always encouraged him to do whatever he wanted including John‚Äôs childhood aspiration to be a baseball star. And he conditioned John to be independent ‚Äì just as he did with John‚Äôs siblings. John described vividly his seven block walk to grade school in N Dakota in 20 degree below freezing weather and 2 feet of snow.  In addition to a roadmap for organizations to build an inclusive culture for people with disabilities, John narrates his lived experience with candor and humor. He became a student manager of a basketball team so he could vicariously fulfil his dream and went on to law school and was co-founder of the American association of People with Disabilities (AAPD).  John Kemp closed his conversation with me by quoting his father saying that everyone in the school will benefit by John being in their classroom- a great analogy for workplaces where entire teams benefit from the presence and inclusion of people with disabilities.  This International Day of People with Disabilities, I encourage you to be a disability ally and to read John‚Äôs book. As the endorsement says, Disability Friendly is a must read book for any twenty first century leader.  You can order the book here",0.5123,POSITIVE,0.9988

2024-12-03,Physio360Chennai,95 followers,"üëâWalking is an essential activity; however, numerous individuals inadvertently employ incorrect techniques that may result in discomfort, inefficiency, or even injury. Here are some guidelines to help you walk correctly.  1. Maintain an upright posture by keeping your head elevated and directed forward, rather than looking downward. Ensure that your shoulders are relaxed and positioned slightly back to prevent any hunching. Engage your core muscles to provide support for your lower back.  2. Arm Movement: Permit your arms to move freely in coordination with your walking pace. Flex your elbows to a 90-degree angle to enhance the intensity of your walk. Refrain from crossing your arms in front of your torso.  3. Foot Placement: Initiate contact with the ground using your heel, subsequently rolling through the foot to propel yourself off with your toes. It is advisable to refrain from stomping or over-striding, as these actions may lead to joint strain.  4. Gait: Ensure that your stride length remains natural; avoid taking excessively long or short steps. Your movements should exhibit a smooth and rhythmic quality.  5.Inhale deeply and maintain a steady rhythm, coordinating your breathing with your movements whenever feasible. Refrain from taking shallow or quick breaths.  ‚ú¥Ô∏èCommon Walking Errors to Avoid 1‚É£Poor Posture: Causes additional strain on the spine and surrounding muscles.  2‚É£Constantly Looking Down: Can lead to neck strain and diminish awareness of your environment.  3‚É£Excessive Striding: Results in inefficiency and increased stress on the joints.  4‚É£Shuffling Feet: May indicate muscle weakness or fatigue.  5‚É£Disregarding Discomfort: Pain experienced while walking could indicate improper form or other underlying problems.

2024-12-03,Pascal Hetzscholdt,"Senior Director, Content Protection at Wiley","Quote: ""Silicon Valley tech giants, including Microsoft and Google, have supported tech companies that provide censorship and policing technologies in China, according to publicly available corporate and promotional materials reviewed by Rest of World. Support for the companies through their startup incubator programs raises questions about the future of these initiatives, especially as Donald Trump prepares to take a second term as president. (...) Over the last decade, China has become a global leader in using new technologies for surveillance and policing. In some cases, the technology enforces traffic rules and finds missing children. But authorities also use cutting-edge software to censor online speech, arrest bloggers and activists, and surveil ethnic minorities, most notably the Uyghur population in the northwestern region of Xinjiang. Two Chinese companies were selling censorship software to support government regulations or working with the police before they joined Microsoft‚Äôs long-running program. AI startup Data Grand sold censorship software to internet companies before joining the incubator in 2017, while cybersecurity firm Tophant partnered with a police research institute back in 2021, before it was accepted into the program in 2023. Two other startups partnered with Chinese police after they graduated from the U.S. tech giant‚Äôs program. In 2018, facial recognition firm DeepGlint worked closely with police in Xinjiang, where the government deployed surveillance tools to oppress ethnic minorities. In 2021, the U.S. sanctioned DeepGlint for its involvement in human rights violations in Xinjiang. Another company, Hydata, collaborated with a police lab in Xinjiang in charge of analyzing surveillance camera footage. The incubator program, called ‚ÄúMicrosoft for Startups,‚Äù has supported more than 800 companies since its launch in China in 2012, according to Microsoft‚Äôs website. The program provides office space, mentorship opportunities, access to Microsoft tools and cloud computing and connects firms with investors and clients. Several U.S. tech companies have introduced similar incubator programs in China to find business partners and expand their own client base in a fast-growing tech industry. (...) Google, Nvidia, and Amazon Web Services ‚Äî Amazon‚Äôs cloud computing arm ‚Äî also run incubation programs in China. Rest of World found documentation, including press releases and media coverage, which showed that one startup supported by Google, LLVision, was providing smart glasses that helped police identify fugitives for several years before joining Google‚Äôs incubator in 2022.

2024-12-03,Colm Dougan,Product Support Analyst at Accenture,"Clay smoking pipes, Thames River finds.   Clay pipes are some of the most interesting objects found on the Thames foreshore in London. Although the pipes are made of thin, fragile clay, the soft Thames mud has protected many of them for centuries.  In the late 16th century, the price of tobacco in London was very expensive as only small quantities of tobacco were imported into the country at that time. Only wealthy individuals could afford to smoke, and the clay pipe bowls were therefore very small. As the imports increased, the price of tobacco dropped, and common people could afford to smoke. The size of the pipe bowls increased steadily through the 17th and 18th centuries as the price of tobacco sank due to increased tobacco production and well-established trade routes to the American colonies.  Considered to be the cigarettes of their day, clay pipes were often pre-filled with tobacco and sold by shops for a single use before they were discarded. It is no wonder that thousands of clay pipes are still found along the Thames foreshore where workers would smoke as they went about their business. The locations of the busiest ports in Georgian and Victorian London can still easily be identified by the number of clay pipe stems and bowls which litter the Thames foreshore to this day.  In the 16th and 17th centuries, clay pipes were mostly undecorated, but in the mid-18th century, clay pipe makers began to use molds with decorative designs. Based on the Royal Coat of Arms of the British monarchy, an English lion and Scottish unicorn were often depicted on opposite sides of the clay pipe bowls made in London between 1730-1770.

Basic Text, p. 35  =  In our addiction, our vision of ourselves was very limited. Each day, we went through the same routine: getting, using, and finding ways and means to get more. And thats all we could reasonably expect for the duration of our lives. Our potential was limited.  Today, our prospects are changed. Recovery has given us a new vision of ourselves and our lives. We are no longer trapped in the endlessly gray routine of addiction. We are free to stretch ourselves in new ways, trying out new ideas and new activities. In doing so, we come to see ourselves in a new way. Our potential is limited only by the strength of the Higher Power that cares for usand that strength has no limits.  In recovery, life and everything in it appears open to us. Guided by our spiritual principles, driven by the power given us by the God of our understanding, our horizons are limitless.  =  Just for today: I will open my eyes to the possibilities before me. My potential is as limitless and as powerful as the God of my understanding. Today, I will act on that potential.  ‚ù§Ô∏èüôèüí™. Jay",0.531,POSITIVE,0.8156

2024-12-03,Theo Dyer,Geopolitics and International Affairs MA graduate,"Syria: Rebel Resurgence and Proxy Conflict  This week the Syrian rebel groups Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and the Syrian National Army (SNA) began an offensive towards Aleppo and the surrounding areas. Why have HTS and the SNA succeeded in pushing back government (Syrian Arab Army/ SAA) forces and what are the potential explanations for their actions?  HTS split from al-Qaeda in 2016 and took control over Idlib in northwestern Syria. The Islamist group governs part of Idlib province and has tried destroy ISIS and other fundamentalists on its territory. The SNA is a coalition of rebel militias trained by T√ºrkiye which control land along the north-western Turkish-Syrian border.  The offensive has taken land in Aleppo, Idlib and Hama provinces and severed the M5 Damascus-Aleppo highway. This was possible because of Syria‚Äôs decline into a theatre for regional competition. Bashar al-Assad‚Äôs weakened SAA only controls two thirds of Syria. The economic collapse and sectarian violence caused by the Syrian Civil War have destroyed the state‚Äôs capacity to govern its territory.  Iran has supported Assad with arms, money and the presence of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Quds Force since 2011. This intervention protected Assad and Iranian supply routes to Lebanon. Iranian and Hezbollah support was crucial to SAA counterattacks against rebels and ISIS. However, the 2024 Israeli-Lebanese conflict left Assad vulnerable by weakening Hezbollah and distracting Iran.  Russia has supported the SAA with airstrikes, as it has done since its intervention in 2015, but the renewal of conflict in 2024 has seen Russian troops retreat from the advancing rebels. This may have been motivated by the constraints placed on Russian resources by the Russo-Ukrainian war. Russia‚Äôs priority is protecting its bases in Tartus and Latakia, which are vital to its Mediterranean naval presence and African logistics routes.  T√ºrkiye has the greatest role in the renewal of hostilities. It organises and arms the SNA and has allowed HTS to exist on the Turkish border. The Turkish army operates outposts in both SNA and HTS territory, with the rebel offensive not being possible without Turkish permission or covert support. T√ºrkiye has previously intervened in Syria to repel the primarily Kurdish SDF from its border, preventing cooperation between Turkish and Syrian Kurdish militias.  T√ºrkiye‚Äôs potential covert support for the rebel offensive could be to drive the SDF and SAA away from the border and resettle Syrian refugees from T√ºrkiye to rebel controlled areas. Repopulating the Syrian border areas with Syrian Arabs would undermine Kurdish separatists inside T√ºrkiye, who want to establish a greater Kurdistan in this region. The offensives also pressure Assad, who during Turkish-Syrian normalisation talks has refused to make concessions such as the return of Syrian refugees or cessation of support for the captagon drug trade.",0.5095,NEGATIVE,0.996

I used to get so frustrated when I couldn‚Äôt hold someone to a standard I wasn‚Äôt keeping to myself.  I learned that I could truly NEVER go ALL IN with someone in a place where I had big gaps in my leadership.  Honestly in my 15 years of leadership and coaching  I‚Äôve had to work behind the scenes continuously closing gaps on how I show up behind the curtain‚Ä¶  So I can show up powerfully in front of it.  This speaks not just about me,  It speaks to the experience I‚Äôve had coaching so many leaders.  They‚Äôve wanted to see external shifts,  But behind the scenes,  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Chaos‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a ‚Äúsh*t show‚Äù ‚Üê their words not mine ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so outta integrity‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not taking my own medicine‚Äù  And this is where a RUSH of imposter syndrome shows up‚Ä¶  The little voice saying  ‚ÄúHow can you teach clients/ customers to do this when you don‚Äôt even do it yourself‚Ä¶ you fraud‚Äù  Every time I‚Äôd go to risk big,  There was this fear that someone was going to see behind the curtain.  So to hide this  I‚Äôd play a smaller game than I‚Äôd know is possible. I‚Äôd not go ALL IN. I‚Äôd make up BS stories about how I couldn‚Äôt close these gaps, that my situation was unique  Until I hired one of the best coaches in the world.  Who saw through my BS like an X-ray. Who‚Äôd hold up a mirror to all of the gaps, And who‚Äôd prescribe me work to go and close them.  I remember how transformational it was (And still is)  I became different.  I created my life differently and OWNED my choices.  Instead of constantly blaming anything I could.  Which in the long term only caused my problems to perpetuate.  Closing these gaps made my confidence skyrocket.  It‚Äôs been my life‚Äôs work helping folks who want the same.  Folks who are FED UP of the same problems or blocks getting in their way.  Folks who want someone in their corner to hold a mirror to their standards.  Who can give them a kind arm round the shoulder and a boot up the backside in the same moment.  Because I know how BIG the ripple effect is when a leader closes the gaps.  When the leader of a household, business, group or team leads at their best.  MAGIC happens. Their CREDIBILITY skyrockets. And the people they serve get the best version of them.  This is why I‚Äôm partnering with 3 people in December.  I want to help YOU map out what's possible & what gaps need to be closed.

It is the question I get often when I talk with the enthusiasm about opportunities in the mobile gaming, apps industry. Especially in the CEE region where many people reminisce with nostalgia easier times. There are many new challenges in the industry.  At the same time it seems to me that many people in those industries forgot about following: ‚ñ™Ô∏è gaming, apps (and actually whole Tech) is ""high risk, high reward"" business - many founders, investors forget the business they are in; you cannot grow in those industries having a high risk aversion ‚ñ™Ô∏è revenue is concentrated at the top. Only the best achieve significant success. Intense competition demands continuous learning and improvement. ‚ñ™Ô∏è once you are starting from a lower level, the only way to catch up is to work harder and risk more...  Seems to me people who have that in mind, feel much better in those industries.

Luckily it worked. ‚ñ™Ô∏è I was born in poor family - choice: easy (passiveness) or hard (constant learning, work during high school, competing with people who were much ahead of me). I ended up in the best economics university in the country. ‚ñ™Ô∏è I saw a computer for the first time in year 2000 at the university (we had none in my village, my previous schools) - I worked hard to learn; 3 years later I worked with Unix servers, 6 years later I had one of most popular blogs about Search Engine Marketing in PL, 7 years later I was starting job at Google in Poland as one of its first employees. ‚ñ™Ô∏è when I went to US as the student for the first time (my first flight ever), I hardly spoke English, our contract was a scam, had enough cash to survive for short time.

2024-12-03,Tom Chaldecott,Simplifying Machinery Safety & Marketplace Legislation.,"The trap key system is a clever safety mechanism that ensures safe access to hazardous areas of machinery. I recently showcased their functionality in a demonstration you can find on YouTube.  Imagine a machine in operation, indicated by a green light. To safely access the inside, you: 1. Turn and remove the key from the barrel, which isolates the machine (the green light goes off). 2. Insert the key into a secondary barrel, turning it to release a trapped key. 3. Push down a safety arm to ensure the key isn‚Äôt left in place unintentionally. 4. Use the trapped key to unlock and open the guard, safely accessing the machine.  This system ensures that the machine cannot be restarted while someone is inside, as it cannot operate without the key returned to its initial position. After maintenance, you reverse the process to restart the machine safely.  Trap key systems are an excellent example of fail-safe design, preventing accidents by controlling the sequence of operations. They provide peace of mind that safety protocols are enforced mechanically, not just procedurally.    Credit toand theteam.",0.5158,POSITIVE,1.0

This marks yet another chapter in the United States Air Force's long campaign to retire an aircraft that has repeatedly proven its worth on the battlefield.  With the A-10 out of the picture, it‚Äôs no wonder North Korea feels comfortable enough to send thousands of its soldiers to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. After all, they no longer need to keep as many eyes (and ears) to the sky, worried about the unmistakable growl of an A-10 delivering its signature ordnance! (Half joking - Half serious!)  On a more serious note, the A-10 has been a cornerstone of U.S. combat operations for decades, providing unparalleled support to ground forces. Its departure from Korea highlights a broader trend of the Air Force shedding the close air support mission - without offering a viable alternative. The F-35, despite its shiny reputation, remains incapable of matching the A-10‚Äôs effectiveness in this role. (Source:)  The A-10 debate transcends the aircraft itself. It's about preserving the trust and reliability ground forces have come to depend on for decades. Removing the A-10 without a capable replacement risks leaving a critical gap in the close air support mission - a role that is fundamental to protecting and empowering those on the ground. As we look to the future, ensuring our forces have what they need to succeed shouldn‚Äôt be overshadowed by the allure of newer technology that fails to meet the same standard.  //,,,,",0.5075,NEGATIVE,0.9609

This semi-automatic rifle, chambered in .308 Winchester, boasts an efficient muzzle brake attached to its 18-inch barrel for quick target acquisition and retention. Kurtenbach extensively evaluates its performance and provides insights into its historical connection with military use, specifically the M14 rifle legacy.  Kurtenbach recounts his first experience with the M14 during military training in Korea and the rifle's legacy as a robust, reliable weapon appreciated for its accuracy and power. Despite being phased out for lighter models like the M16 in the U.S. armed forces, the M14 continued to be prized by military snipers and marksmen for its long-range precision and power. This historical context frames the review of the M1A Scout Squad, highlighting its direct lineage to the M14.  The M1A Scout Squad, part of Springfield Armory's M1A series, maintains the classic wood stock design for traditionalists and offers modern features like a detachable magazine system and advanced muzzle brake.

11/26/2024,Messanga-Messanga Frederic Mike Yvan,Aircraft Maintenance Technician | Ensuring Safety & Efficiency in Aviation.,"Airbus reportedly wins France‚Äôs Maritime Patrol Aircraft program over Dassault  Unconfirmed reports suggest that the French Ministry of the Armed Forces has chosen Airbus Defence & Space over Dassault Aviation for its future maritime patrol aircraft (Patmar) program, according to information from La Tribune. Supposedly, this decision has been communicated to both manufacturers, but it has yet to be publicly announced by official authorities. The Patmar program aims to replace France‚Äôs fleet of 18 Atlantique 2 (ATL2) maritime patrol aircraft by 2030.  The Dassault-Breguet ATL2 entered service in 1992 in the Marine Nationale, though it is based on the Breguet Atlantic, an airframe developed in the 1960s. Powered by two Rolls-Royce Tyne engines, the aircraft has a maximum speed of 600 kilometers per hour and a range of over 7,300 kilometers. It can carry up to 3.5 tons of armaments, including depth charges, mines, and torpedoes, and fire MBDA AM-39 Exocet anti-ship missiles.  Airbus vs. Dassault: Contrasting philosophies in Maritime Patrol Aircraft proposals Two proposals were in competition for this contract: Airbus Defence & Space submitted a military variant of the A321XLR (Extra Long Range), while Dassault Aviation offered a modified version of the Falcon 10X business jet. The A321XLR was certified in July 2024 and entered service with Iberia on November 6, 2024. The aircraft boasts an 11-hour flight endurance and offers significant payload capacity, enabling it to carry an extensive array of equipment for the French Navy‚Äôs missions once converted.  This future A321MPA was first presented at the Euronaval 2024 trade show, held in Paris between November 4 and 7, 2024. The main modification visible on the presented model was a long ammunition bay located underneath the fuselage. Thales is set to supply the sensor suite for this aircraft. In contrast, Dassault emphasized the speed and agility of its Falcon 10X, which should enter service in 2025. The manufacturer also highlighted its experience in the domain. Militarized versions of the Falcon 10, 20 (200 Gardian), and 50 participate in surveillance and rescue missions within the French maritime territory, pilot training, and the transportation of authorities. Seven Albatros maritime surveillance and intervention aircraft based on Dassault‚Äôs Falcon 2000LXS business jet should be delivered to the French Navy in 2025.  However, it appears that ultimately the French authorities favored the A321XLR based on its superior payload capacity, which better aligns with operational needs despite its higher cost.

The Su-57 ‚Äì by the way, we already have the first contracts signed for this aircraft_‚Äù, said the head of the company, Alexander Mikheyev, in an interview with the Rossiya 1 TV channel (VGTRK), and published by the TASS agency.  ‚Äú _The economic effect is that we have our market presence and our partners from friendly countries want to buy proven reliable Russian weaponry and correspondingly support our industry with export orders so that we can develop further and, from generation to generation , create new products for the next 10 to 15 years_,‚Äù said Mikheyev.  There were rumors that China could be the likely customer, considering the fact that Russia's United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) brought the aircraft to the China Airshow 2024. The Su-57E's flying displays delighted the crowds at the show even more than China's own aircraft such as the J-20 and J-35.  Yesterday, Dmitry Shugaev, head of the Russian Federal Service for Military-Technical Cooperation, hinted that China would be a customer for Russian military equipment. These are the most modern air defense systems, radar equipment and combat aircraft._‚Äù  Another client could be Algeria, according to unconfirmed reports circulating. Algerian authorities have shown great interest in the Su-57 in the past, visiting its factories and arms fairs in Russia.  The Su-57 is a multi-purpose twin-engine stealth fighter developed by Russian company Sukhoi. It is a product of the PAK FA program, which was started in 1999 as a more modern and affordable alternative to the MFI project. Sukhoi's internal designation for the aircraft is T-50. The Su-57 is the first aircraft in Russian military service designed with stealth technology and is intended to be the basis for a family of stealth combat aircraft.  As a multi-role fighter capable of aerial combat as well as land and sea attack, the Su-57 incorporates stealth, super-maneuverability, super-cruise, integrated avionics and substantial internal payload capability.  The first prototype aircraft flew in 2010, but the program would undergo prolonged development due to several structural and technical problems that arose during testing, including the destruction of the first production aircraft in an accident before its delivery. After repeated delays, the first Su-57 entered service with the Russian Aerospace Forces (VKS) in December 2020. The fighter is expected to have a service life of up to 35 years.

11/19/2024,East Texas Krav Maga,81 followers,"The Principle of ""WIN"" (Whatever Is Necessary) At the heart of Krav Maga is the principle of ""WIN""‚Äîwhatever is necessary to survive. This principle reinforces the idea that in self-defense, the ultimate goal is to protect yourself and escape danger, using whatever tactics are most effective. Forward Planning, Backward Execution Krav Maga practitioners are taught to plan their moves strategically and execute them with precision. Forward planning involves anticipating your attacker‚Äôs next move, identifying escape routes, and making quick decisions to protect yourself. The idea is to be one step ahead of the attacker at all times. Tactical Awareness: Tactical awareness is crucial in self-defense. Krav Maga teaches you how to assess your surroundings, spot potential threats early, and position yourself in a way that maximizes your ability to defend and escape. Preparation for the Unexpected: While forward planning is critical, Krav Maga also emphasizes the importance of flexibility. Not all situations go according to plan, and practitioners are trained to adjust their tactics based on how the encounter unfolds. Practical, Goal-Oriented Techniques Krav Maga is built around practical techniques that aim to neutralize threats as quickly as possible. The objective is not to ""win"" a fight in the traditional sense but to incapacitate or escape from an attacker in the shortest amount of time. Targeting Vulnerable Areas: Krav Maga techniques focus on striking the attacker‚Äôs vulnerable areas‚Äîeyes, throat, groin, and knees. These areas are chosen because they offer the highest chance of disabling the attacker, regardless of their size or strength. Immediate Counterattacks: In Krav Maga, counterattacks are launched as soon as an attack begins. Practitioners are taught to move forward aggressively, using strikes, knees, and elbows to overwhelm and incapacitate the attacker quickly. The goal is to end the threat as fast as possible. Adaptability in Combat In real-world scenarios, situations can change rapidly, and Krav Maga‚Äôs ""WIN"" principle teaches practitioners to adapt their techniques to the specific conditions of the fight. Whether facing a single attacker, multiple assailants, or an armed opponent, practitioners must be able to adjust their tactics and techniques in real-time. Key Takeaway: The principle of ""WIN"" in Krav Maga emphasizes doing whatever is necessary to survive and escape danger. By teaching forward planning, practical techniques, and adaptability, Krav Maga ensures that practitioners are always prepared to handle unexpected situations.",0.5117,POSITIVE,0.9991

11/19/2024,Vikrant Tyagi,"Senior Director - Strategic Operations, HR, and Program Management at Indian Army | Data Science & Finance Expert","The Indian Air Force indeed faces a stark contrast when compared to China's rapid advancements in next-generation air combat platforms, particularly with the introduction of the Shenyang J-35 at the 2024 Zhuhai Air Show.  China is not only producing but also preparing to integrate its second fifth-generation stealth fighter jet, India lags behind in terms of operational fifth-generation fighters and the corresponding advanced carrier capabilities. India‚Äôs journey towards a fifth-generation fighter has been prolonged and, so far, unfruitful.  The indigenous Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA) project, which aims to produce India‚Äôs first fifth-generation stealth fighter, is still in the development phase.  Despite optimism surrounding AMCA's prototype and testing timelines, the project remains years away from potentially achieving operational status. In a high-stakes arms race, delays in developing such platforms put the IAF at a critical disadvantage.  The challenge extends beyond airframes. The J-35 is tailored for multirole capabilities similar to the American F-35 variants‚Äîbuilt for air, land, and naval deployment.  China‚Äôs focus on interoperability across air force and navy operations, supported by the EMALS-equipped Fujian carrier, demonstrates a seamless strategy for the future of integrated, networked warfare.  The IAF, in contrast, currently operates no dedicated stealth fighter for potential deployment on India's aircraft carriers. India's carriers, INS Vikrant and INS Vikramaditya, still rely on conventional MiG-29Ks, which lack the stealth features, agility, and network-centric warfare capabilities offered by fifth-generation platforms.  As conflicts become increasingly networked, with stealth, electronic warfare, and data integration at the forefront, India's current fleet, which comprises mostly fourth-generation fighters like the Su-30 MKI and Mirage 2000, struggles to match the evolving threat landscape shaped by China‚Äôs advancements.  The absence of a fifth-generation stealth fighter in the IAF inventory places India in a challenging position when it comes to establishing air dominance or ensuring survival against future-generation adversaries.  In terms of a game-changing platform, the IAF remains in catch-up mode. Even with plans to acquire more advanced Rafale jets and possibly other platforms, the current focus is still on bolstering fourth-generation capabilities rather than shifting towards a truly fifth-generation, multi-role combat solution.",0.5167,NEGATIVE,0.7754

In each case, the robot trained on the team's model performed the same surgical procedures as skillfully as human doctors. ‚úÖThe model combined imitation learning with the same machine learning architecture that underpins ChatGPT. However, where ChatGPT works with words and text, this model speaks ""robot"" with kinematics, a language that breaks down the angles of robotic motion into math. ‚úÖThe researchers fed their model hundreds of videos recorded from wrist cameras placed on the arms of da Vinci robots during surgical procedures.  ‚ô¶These videos, recorded by surgeons all over the world, are used for post-operative analysis and then archived.

Initially conceptualized during World War I, the formidable machine gun addressed the challenge posed by German observation balloons and aircraft, which were shielded from standard small arms fire. The call to create a powerful weapon came from American General John J. ""Black Jack"" Pershing, leading to collaboration with John Moses Browning, a legendary firearms designer. By adopting elements from the German Mauser Tankgewehr M1918 anti-tank rifle and enhancing specifications, the M2 machine gun emerged as an influential tool with a high muzzle velocity, evolving into a versatile weapon platform.  The M2 .50-caliber machine gun, commonly referred to as ""Ma Deuce,"" became integral to US military operations across different branches and roles. Its adaptability allowed for incorporation into tanks, naval vessels, aircraft, and numerous ground platforms. The M2HB variant, a result of posthumous modifications to Browning‚Äôs design, honored the prototype's strengths through durability, long-range effectiveness, and unmatched stopping power against a myriad of targets, including vehicles and fortified positions. Despite various attempts over the decades to innovate beyond Browning's original design, the M2's indisputable efficacy ensured its continued use worldwide.  The article further discusses the ammunition types and operational nuances of the M2, such as its feeding mechanisms, firing modes, and the absence of a manual safety, requiring field improvisations for security. The adoption of the M2A1 model introduced enhancements like a quick-change barrel system and fixes to headspace and timing issues, reflecting modern advancements while preserving the timeless robustness of the weapon. Now, over a century since its inception, the M2 continues to hold primacy in American military arsenals, validating its status as a remarkably enduring fixture in both historical and contemporary military conflict.",0.5092,POSITIVE,0.9976

This evolution reflects changes in tactics, technology, and countermeasures.  Early Stages (2006-2010) Basic IEDs: Initially, IEDs were relatively simple, often using readily available materials like ANFO. These devices were typically command-detonated using basic electronic circuits. Roadside Bombs: The primary tactic involved placing IEDs along roadsides to target military convoys and supply routes.  Mid-Evolution (2011-2015) Increased Sophistication: AS began incorporating more sophisticated components, such as military-grade explosives and advanced triggering mechanisms, including pressure plates and remote-controlled devices. Diversification of Tactics: The group diversified its tactics, employing VBIEDs and PBIEDs to target high-profile locations and individuals. International Influence: There was a notable influence from international terrorist organizations, particularly AQAP, which provided technical expertise and advanced components. Recent Developments (2016-Present) Technological Advancements: The use of more advanced technology, such as mobile phones and radio-controlled triggers, has increased the effectiveness and lethality of IEDs. Complex Attacks: AS has executed complex attacks involving multiple IEDs and coordinated assaults, such as the 2017 Mogadishu truck bombing. Adaptation to Countermeasures: The group has adapted to C-IED measures by developing low-metal content IEDs to evade detection and using decoy devices to confuse and overwhelm security forces.  Detection Techniques and Equipment EDD: EDD teams have been crucial in detecting IEDs, especially in high-risk areas like airports and military bases. Advanced Sensors: The use of GPR and other advanced sensors has improved the detection of buried IEDs.  MVCP: These are deployed to inspect vehicles for hidden IEDs, using a combination of manual searches and advanced scanning equipment.  Training and Capacity Building Comprehensive Training Programs: AMISOM and Somali forces have undergone extensive training in IED detection, disposal, and post-blast investigation. These programs are often supported by international partners like UNMAS and the UKMST. Continuous Re-evaluation: Due to the evolving nature of IED threats, there is a constant re-evaluation of personnel skills and updating them on new trends to ensure they can operate efficiently and deliver on their mission mandate.  Conclusion The evolution of IED tactics in Somalia reflects a continuous arms race between militant groups and C-IED forces. While AS has developed increasingly sophisticated devices and tactics, international and local forces have responded with advanced detection techniques, equipment, and comprehensive training programs. This ongoing battle underscores the need for constant vigilance, adaptation, and innovation in C-IED efforts.",0.5217,POSITIVE,0.9983

11/12/2024,Rommel Gavieta,Infra & Digital Connectivity Adviser at Philippine Reclamation Authority,"Credit to Thomas Newdick Oct 17, 2024  Army Confirms It‚Äôs Exploring Requirements For A New Heavy-Lift Helicopter To Replace Chinook    A CH-47 Chinook replacement remains a major unknown when it comes to the U.S. Army's Future Vertical Lift vision.  The U.S. Army is actively exploring options for a new-generation heavy-lift rotorcraft to replace the CH-47 Chinook. Although plans are still very much in their infancy, they have broader implications for future heavy-lift capabilities, especially for the Pacific theater.  Confirmation that work on a Chinook successor is ongoing comes as the service progresses with its Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) tiltrotor, which will replace part of the UH-60 Black Hawk fleet, and after its cancelation of the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA), which would have partially replaced the OH-58D Kiowa Warrior armed scout helicopter, now retired without any plans for a direct successor.  In response to a question from TWZ, Brig. Gen. Cain Baker, the director of the Future Vertical Lift Cross-Functional Team, or FVL CFT, at Army Futures Command, provided an update on Chinook replacement plans at the Association of the U.S. Army‚Äôs annual symposium yesterday. Within the Army, this is known as Capability Set, or ‚ÄúCape Set,‚Äù Four, part of the wider Future Vertical Lift (FVL) effort. FLRAA and FARA were responses to other FVL Capability Sets. Cap Set 4 also evolved in part from earlier efforts, including the Joint Heavy Lift (JHL) and Joint Multi-Role (JMR) programs.  In the meantime, the Army‚Äôs Chinook fleet ‚Äî which numbers more than 470 aircraft ‚Äî will soldier on as the service‚Äôs heavy-lift rotorcraft for many more years to come. This could be aided by the latest Chinook Block II upgrade program. This includes new rotor blades, a revised fuel tank configuration, and other improvements, while there is also a separate option to add more powerful General Electric T408 engines.  While the structural and performance enhancements introduced in the Chinook Block II program add speed and lift to an airframe design that‚Äôs now over 60 years old, the helicopter offers nothing close to FLRAA levels of performance. At the same time, Chinook Block II has always been seen as a stopgap until a replacement platform can be defined, a conundrum Cape Set Four is now grappling with.  Other than the Chinook, the only other suitable heavy-lift rotorcraft currently in production is the CH-53K King Stallion, as operated by the U.S. Marine Corps.  Along with concerns over rotorcraft survivability is the interest expressed by the Army (as well as the Marine Corps and Air Force) in distributed logistics chains, leveraging, at least in part, increasingly large uncrewed aerial cargo platforms. This could also raise questions about whether a new heavy-lift platform is necessary or cost-effective.",0.5198,NEGATIVE,0.9133

The value of these rare items isn't just about their age‚Äîit's the craftsmanship, historical significance, and the story they tell. A weapon from a particular era or conflict can increase in value based on its unique provenance, rare materials, and condition. For collectors, understanding these factors is essential.  It's also important to consider the market trends. As more collectors enter the field, some weapons experience a surge in demand. Limited availability and growing interest in specific types of arms‚Äîsuch as medieval swords or Civil War firearms‚Äîcan drive prices higher. Keeping an eye on these trends can give collectors an edge when buying and selling.  Lastly, authenticity plays a crucial role in determining a weapon‚Äôs value. Always ensure you‚Äôre purchasing from reputable sources and be wary of reproductions. Genuine historical weapons are treasures to be preserved and cherished for generations.",0.5197,POSITIVE,0.9997

The service only sent Typhon, which currently uses large tractor-trailer launchers to fire Tomahawk cruise missiles and SM-6 multi-purpose missiles, overseas for the first time to the Philippines earlier this year.  Typhon, also known as the Mid-Range Capability (MRC), was among the topics of discussion at a panel talk centered on the Army‚Äôs new Multi-Domain Task Forces (MTDF) at the Association of the U.S. Army‚Äôs (AUSA) main annual conference earlier today. Typhon is a key component of the current approved force structure for the service‚Äôs three MDTFs. In addition to Typhon, each of the task forces is set to eventually incorporate units armed with the Dark Eagle hypersonic missiles and the Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) short-range ballistic missiles, as well as a variety of air and missile defense, counter-drone, electronic warfare, and other advanced capabilities.  ‚ÄúSo, the Mid-Range Capability, we fielded it, we have put it into the theater, but we‚Äôre learning lessons on how we can improve the next evolutions of that,‚Äù Army Col. Michael Rose, commander of the 3rd MDTF headquartered at Fort Shafter in Hawaii, said today at AUSA. ‚ÄúHow do we make it more mobile? How do we make it smaller? How do we make it more agile? How do we employ it most effectively and how do we sustain it? A lot of those lessons are feeding back into our RDT&E [research, development, test, and evaluations] and acquisitions professionals to improve and enhance that new operational capability.‚Äù  Rose did not elaborate further, but it is not hard to see how Typhon‚Äôs current configuration, which is technically road-mobile and air-transportable, might present certain operational limitations. At the core of a typical Typhon battery at present are four trailer-based launchers, each towed by an 8√ó8 tractor from the Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT) family. A fifth trailer, also towed by a HEMTT tractor, provides a mobile battery operations center (BOC). There are other supporting vehicles and equipment in the unit‚Äôs inventory, as well.  It‚Äôs also worth noting that each Typhon launcher, which is derived from the Mk 41 Vertical Launch System (VLS) used on various U.S. and foreign warships, can only hold up to four missiles at a time. As such, the entire battery can fire 16 missiles before needing to reload, which requires additional vehicles and equipment.",0.5322,POSITIVE,0.9368

Let‚Äôs call him Mr. Sanjay (because that was his name). He had this uncanny knack for cutting through corporate fluff like a hot knife through buttered PowerPoint slides.  One fine morning, during a tense quarterly review, I presented a strategy that I was sure would get me a standing ovation. Instead, Sanjay sir sat back, folded his arms, and said:  ‚ÄúSahil, your slide deck is great. But do you know the problem with great? It‚Äôs comfortable. And comfort zones are like bean bags, cozy at first, but if you stay too long, you become useless.‚Äù  Ouch. That stung.  He continued, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve solved today‚Äôs problem, but where‚Äôs tomorrow‚Äôs challenge? Strategy isn‚Äôt just about what you see; it‚Äôs about anticipating what‚Äôs hidden. If you want to lead, stop solving for applause and start solving for silence, the kind that comes when people have nothing left to question.‚Äù  Mic drop.  It was like being hit by a wisdom truck.

For comparison, in China, WeChat had only been online for a year, and Alipay had just launched QR code payments. In Brazil, various fintech companies were also being established around this time.  Unlike others, EBANX has not developed its own payment tools. Instead, it aggregates the payment methods of various Latin American countries online, enabling local consumers to shop cross-border using familiar payment methods.  At that time, no one in emerging markets was doing this. In 2012, Brazil's e-commerce industry was in its infancy‚ÄîAmazon had just entered Brazil and wasn‚Äôt fully operational, and only a small fraction of people with international credit cards could purchase imported goods online.

It integrates more than 200 commonly used payment methods in emerging markets, reaching over 1 billion consumers worldwide.

This is a question that invites deeper reflections.   When you have some time this weekend, take a moment to ponder and see what surfaces.  Often, when we find ourselves repeatedly thinking about something, it‚Äôs a sign that it deserves our attention. For me, I‚Äôve been reflecting on how best to support the people around me who are ageing.  This thought has been on my mind after a few recent trips to the hospital, accompanying my eldest sibling for her annual health check and a meeting with the dietitian about necessary adjustments to her diet. As I held my eldest sister's arm and walked her to my car, it struck me how much she has aged.  These experiences have led me to think more about nutrition and, importantly, how I can spend more meaningful time with the people I love.  I‚Äôve also been reflecting on the things I wanted to do but have set aside. This morning, I decided to act on one of them‚ÄîI picked up my guitar and recorded a birthday song for Aunty K*. Knowing she spends much of her time alone at home, I wanted to bring a little joy and create a special moment for her on her birthday.  Sorting through what‚Äôs been on my mind brought me clarity‚Äîand clarity led me to actions.  What about you? What's been on your mind lately?  Will you take a closer look at it?      *Aunty K was my landlord when I rented a room at her house in my college years, some three decades back.

Thank you for any support!","Continue from the Previous post. ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Autumn In Love Day 36 Part 2/2  I wanted to do more for those elders, but as an intern, I needed to improve my ability to effect change. Still, I sought to be a voice for them. By sharing this, you will be surprised and compelled to reflect. I pray it will resonate with you.  Now, back to the story about the auntie. She expressed that she had no chance to meet people in the outside world. I mentioned that I had a new method to help her with physical therapy for her fingers, arms, and smile.üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ  I suggested that she try online dating. Her eyes lit up at the idea. She then told me that she had a Tinder account when her first husband passed away‚Äîthe one she married before moving to America. After meeting her husband, she stopped using Tinder but never closed the account. Unfortunately, she couldn't remember the email or password. I assured her it wouldn't be a problem and restored her Tinder account.  When I logged in, I was shocked! She looked amazing. She had a great figure and a beautiful face and dressed surprisingly well for her age. She smiled proudly and shared that many men greeted and chatted with her daily, which made her heart flutter. Every time she recounted this, she smiled and laughed. I then asked her if she was ready to be a mother again. She hugged me tightly, beaming, and replied that she was more than ready.  However, she lamented that no facial massages, face masks, or off-site spas were available. It took a lot of work to request such services. I told her that my grandmother and mother had taught me a herbal facial scrub and massage formula using locally available plants. It's 100% safe for the skin, and I assured her I could make her feel beautiful within a week. I advised her to test it on the skin under her arm first to check her sensitivity.  Speaking of my grandmother's skin spa formula, I had a lot of free time these days, so I decided to start a spa focused on beauty and preparation for Christmas.üòâüòâüòâ  A week later, I had to care for a bedridden older man, a former business owner who was once ranked in the top 5 of the country. Although wealthy, he was now alone in a nursing home, which was still in the same building as my aunt's VIP zone. One morning, I ran into the aunt. She called me over, hugged me tightly, and cried joyfully. I was surprised and asked if she had found her soulmate. Laughing, she said she had met many soulmates.ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£  I felt encouraged by her progress and told her daughter, who lives in America, that she wanted to move to a house by the sea she had purchased long ago. The auntie bought it for her retirement with her husband. Now, her daughter was redecorating it to make it wheelchair-friendly, creating a new bathroom, bedroom, and kitchen, essentially tearing down and renovating the entire house.

Some with years of experience, others just starting out‚Äîbut all united by one purpose: to create spaces where transformation happens.  As I stepped in, I didn‚Äôt just attend the IAF conference‚ÄîI experienced it. From the first conversation to the last closing session, it felt like walking into a kaleidoscope of ideas, stories, and revelations...  One moment, I was laughing at the quirky metaphors facilitators use to explain the unexplainable. The next, I was utterly mesmerized by the depth of thought behind their methods. It was like sitting in on a secret symposium of wisdom where every word had the power to unlock something within me.  And then came the affirmation. That spine-tingling, soul-nourishing realization: ‚ÄúThis is why I do what I do.‚Äù Every exercise, every interaction, and every heartfelt story reminded me that facilitation isn‚Äôt just about techniques or tools. It‚Äôs about creating moments of magic‚Äîmoments where someone sees their own potential for the first time or finally connects the dots on a long-awaited breakthrough.  The best part?

2024-12-13,Pamela D. Nyakabau,Marketing Executive at Dandemutande,"Six years ago, my family‚Äôs life changed forever. My mother, once a strong and hardworking woman, became a stroke survivor. Today, she is but a shadow of her former self‚Äîa mere existence of the vibrant person she once was. Watching her struggle daily with the simplest of tasks‚Äîtying her shoelaces, lifting a glass, or even forming a sentence‚Äîbreaks my heart in ways words can‚Äôt fully describe. It‚Äôs a pain I carry every day, and it pushes me to raise awareness about this cruel, often misunderstood condition.  What Is a Stroke?  A stroke is a sudden disruption of blood flow to the brain, either because of a blocked artery (ischemic stroke) or a ruptured blood vessel (hemorrhagic stroke). Deprived of oxygen, brain cells die within minutes, leading to permanent damage. Stroke is swift, devastating, and life-altering. But it‚Äôs also preventable‚Äîif only you know what to look for.  The Signs We Missed  Reflecting on my mother‚Äôs life, I now see the warnings were there all along, subtle but persistent: ‚Ä¢ She tripped and fell often. ‚Ä¢ Her left hand grew weaker, unable to hold even the lightest objects. ‚Ä¢ Her smile became uneven, the left side drooping slightly. ‚Ä¢ There were moments of slurred speech that seemed insignificant at the time.  We didn‚Äôt realize these signs were her body crying out for help. Then came the night she fell from her bed. By the time we rushed her to the hospital, it was too late to undo the damage.  The acronym BE FAST could have changed everything: ‚Ä¢ Balance issues: Frequent falls or unsteadiness. ‚Ä¢ Eyesight problems: Sudden or gradual vision loss. ‚Ä¢ Facial drooping: An uneven or lopsided smile. ‚Ä¢ Arm weakness: Difficulty raising or holding things. ‚Ä¢ Speech difficulties: Slurring or confusion. ‚Ä¢ Time to act: Every second counts when stroke strikes.  Why This Hurts So Much  It‚Äôs hard to describe the heartbreak of seeing someone you love‚Äîa person who once ran the household, worked tirelessly, and radiated strength‚Äîreduced to struggling with basic tasks. My mother‚Äôs laugh, once so full of life, is now a faint echo. Her once-powerful hands now tremble under the smallest weight.  Stroke has stolen so much from her, from us. And yet, this is why I share her story. To anyone reading this: if you notice these symptoms in someone you love, act immediately. Call for help. Don‚Äôt hesitate.   This is not just my mother‚Äôs story‚Äîit‚Äôs a wake-up call. Stroke doesn‚Äôt discriminate; it can strike anyone, anytime. Knowing the signs and acting quickly can mean the difference between recovery and irreversible damage.  If I had known what I know now, her story might have been different. But while I can‚Äôt rewrite the past, I can use it to light the way for others. Don‚Äôt wait for hindsight to teach you this painful lesson. Recognize the signs. BE FAST. Save a life.  For my mother, for your loved ones, and for the countless families who can be spared this heartbreak‚Äîlet‚Äôs raise awareness of this silent thief.",0.508,NEGATIVE,0.953

2024-12-13,"Steven-Paul Walker MBA, CISA, CGEIT, CICA",Risk and Regulatory Compliance Practice Expert | Certified Information Systems Auditor,"An interesting article on potentially a whole new world of doing business. The risks associated with streamlining or eliminating the regulatory oversight mechanism role can be fraught with red flags. Eliminating a cabinet level agency or the supervisory arm of the FDIC and though it's not mentioned, the supervisory arm the Federal Reserve (regulator of bank holding companies) would require a great deal of congressional scrutiny and I suspect at the end of day, would find bi-partisan support for taking cautionary steps in this direction. It's been my professional experience that when regulatory contact is performed with common sense, adherence to law and in accordance with best business practices, senior bank managers and board directors find the discussions positive and very helpful to their enterprise risk management processes and control activities. I would even argue institutions with a strong culture of controls encouraged by internal audit and excellent regulation retain strong franchise value. Stay tuned regarding changes like what's being contemplated by the in-coming administration as outlined in this article. If this path is followed a significant level of safeguards could be removed from the financial services industry which will no doubt permeate public perception. Institutions of all asset sizes and profiles of complexity are already challenged with existing safety and soundness rules in areas such as risk-based capital planning, credit risk, net interest margin maintenance, liquidity and funds management. Financial institutions are now facing an array of emerging technology and operational risk introduced by cryptocurrency, blockchain and AI; these technologies are promising to influence their business model in ways they may not be totally ready to implement or factor into their enterprise risk management programs. Effective, independent and efficient supervisory regulation can be very helpful in helping bank managers navigate and focus their efforts when addressing these risks. Further, it can ensure the ground rules for competition remain even and consistent among market participants as managers navigate these challenges going forward.",0.531,POSITIVE,0.961

2024-12-14,The Prophet Obblonge,I am not the only chosen one.,"This is exactly what the coward in Lake Orion, Michigan that has cut off all communication with my fianc√© and friend of 38 years has done.   He has engaged in a public and private gaslighting campaign for years now, stealing the identities of family members both living and dead. This has been documented using the guidelines of the National Domestic Abuse Hotline.  There is no evidence that she is still alive.  Many websites are filled with stories of people who barely escaped - and those posted in memory of the many who did not.  The last person Patricia Ann Roberts/Coffey/Dumas/Randle, 56, was seen with is an outspoken 'ranking member' of a white supremacist organization, QAnon conspiracist, Rush Limbaugh clone. A half-Hispanic neo-nazi hypocrite - typical Christian conservative Republican - the only political agenda that welcomes narcissistic abusers with open arms.",0.504,NEGATIVE,0.999

2024-12-14,Institute for the Study of War,"110,243 followers","NEW: Russian forces conducted their largest series of missile and drone strikes against Ukraine since the start of the war overnight on December 12 to 13, largely targeting Ukrainian energy infrastructure.  Read more in the December 13, 2024 Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment:  Russia's strike series targeting Ukrainian energy facilities is part of a broader campaign aimed at freezing out Ukraine in Winter 2024-2025 and compelling Ukraine and the West to self-deter into making policy decisions that benefit Russia.  Ukrainian strikes against military airfields in Russia and Russian air defense systems in near rear areas may be prompting a decrease in Russian air operations and glide bomb strikes against Ukraine.  Russia is evacuating elements of its force grouping in Syria while continuing negotiations with select Syrian groups about Russia's longer-term military presence in the country.  The status of Russia's helicopter base at Qamishli in northeastern Syria remains unclear, however.  The US Department of Defense (DoD) announced on December 12 a new military aid package for Ukraine valued at $500 million.  A Russian insider source who has previously correctly predicted command changes within the Russian military responded to recent claims that the Russian military command removed 3rd Combined Arms Army (formerly 2nd Luhansk People's Republic Army Corps) commander Major General Dmitry Ovcharov.  Russian forces recently advanced near Pokrovsk and Vuhledar.  Russian President Vladimir Putin awarded Rosgvardia Head Viktor Zolotov with the Hero of Russia award.",0.527,NEGATIVE,0.992
