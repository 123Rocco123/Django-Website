With the increasing complexity and performance demands of modern vehicles, here are few of my key takeaways on why chiplets are so crucial:  üîπ Modularity: Chiplets allow for the integration of specialized functions on separate dies, which can be combined to form a complete system. This modular approach enhances flexibility and performance customization.  üîπ Cost and Yield Improvements: Manufacturing smaller chiplets instead of large monolithic chips improves yield and reduces costs.  üîπ Scalability: Chiplets enable easier scaling of automotive systems by allowing manufacturers to upgrade selected components while reusing others, specifically as we enable higher levels of ADAS and IVI applications.  üîπ Thermal Management: Separating functions across chiplets helps in better thermal management. This is crucial for maintaining performance and longevity in automotive environments.
