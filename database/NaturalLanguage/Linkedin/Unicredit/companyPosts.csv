Un Paese in cui la famiglia vale più degli affari.   Il successo non è una variabile individuale, è il risultato di competenze e conoscenze coltivate e condivise per secoli tra famiglie e comunità. Tramandate di generazione in generazione.  In questo periodo dell’anno, l’unione, la condivisione e i legami tra famiglia e comunità sono importanti. Sono ciò che ci permette di vedere oltre noi stessi verso qualcosa di più grande.  Incrediamo che il vero potenziale sia sbloccato attraverso la forza della collettività, non del singolo, unendoci con determinazione per realizzare un futuro migliore.

To help make the impossible possible for the young student looking to open their first bank account, the family that has fallen on hard times, and the chef looking to expand his business.
