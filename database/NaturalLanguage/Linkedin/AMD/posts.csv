Modalities are continuously improving to advance in better therapeutic strategies related to disease markers and drug targets.  Above, the proof-of-concept study using multiomics data aimed to unravel age-related macular degeneration (AMD) pathophysiology.  Pathogenesis is still incompletely understood, but involves complement system (CS) activation and lipid dysregulation.  üö©Differential of this study: a systematic multiomics data integration analysis (genetics, metabolomics and proteomics) in the context of AMD!  ‚ñ™Ô∏éSetting: 155 cases of AMD (SIE study) -77 female (49.7%), 83 hypertensive (53.5%), 45 diabetic (29%).  In discussion, authors reported that among all the possible interactions between complement proteins and lipids, a significant one was found between sphingomyelin and C1R. The odds of AMD were 2 times higher for individuals with low levels of sphingomyelin and C1R.  Sphingolipids are known to be involved in the regulation of many physiological and pathophysiological processes in the retina. Moreover, homeostasis of different sphingolipids plays a role in the maintenance, progression, and regulation of the immune response.  Limitations? Yes! Limitations include population ethnicity, limited sample size, early and intermediate AMD were pooled in a single category.  üòäPrognosis and hope: In future, precision health will aim to predict, prevent, and cure diseases more precisely by taking into account each individual‚Äôs genetics, environment, and lifestyle factors in contrast to the ‚Äúone-size-fits all‚Äù and reactive approach of traditional medicine.  ‚ÑπÔ∏èRead more: ‚ñ™Ô∏éInterplay between Lipids and Complement Proteins‚ÄîHow Multiomics Data Integration Can Help Unravel Age-related Macular Degeneration Pathophysiology: A Proof-of-concept Study.

As I was preparing for the and conference in Berlin on 11 December, my daughter who is studying economics in Rotterdam walked in - and showed me her textbook with now quite old framework* - the BCG Matrix used to decide on portfolio of businesses to divest and invest in. She asked me - is this relevant in your work still dad?  This made me step back, smile and start reflecting on how traditional frameworks like the for prioritising investments might evolve for the renewable fuels world. What if we rethought the axes?  Instead of market share and market growth, imagine the BCG Matrix used to prioritise investments or divestments mapped to:  Policy Alignment (X-axis): How aligned is a company's strategy with regulatory direction?  Agility (Y-axis): How quickly can a company adapt to shifting energy policies and market needs?  With these new axes, who would be the of renewable fuels? Likely, it‚Äôs firms leading in both agility and alignment‚Äîthink digital-first hydrogen pioneers, flexible biofuel / efuel innovators, and CCUS-driven decarbonization platforms. These companies have both the policy focus and ability to pivot as targets evolve.  Cash ? Established LNG exporters or oil majors investing heavily in biofuels amd Hydrogen derivatives ‚Äîwell aligned but slower to adapt.  ? Early-stage hydrogen startups or e-fuel developers‚Äîinnovative but navigating regulatory ambiguity.  to divest? Technologies with high inertia and weak alignment, such as rigid fossil-dependent processes firms that refuse to back energy transition.  For investors and policymakers, this reframed matrix underscores importance of two challenges when thinking on investment landscape improvement for moving gasworld to netzero:  1) How do we foster policy clarity to guide policy alignment for energy industry?  2) How can industry enhance agility in navigating rapid transitions to follow and anticipate policy?  Looking forward to exploring this idea and debating in our panel with energy leaders in Berlin on 11 December including,, and.  What‚Äôs your take? Are ability to deal with agility and policy alignment the right metrics for picking the firms best positioned for the renewable fuels transition? Let me know, or let‚Äôs grab a coffee in Berlin.

2024-11-24,Robert Kargbo,CMC Project Lead at Usona Institute,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a progressive degenerative disease that leads to visual impairment, predominantly affecting the elderly. Despite significant advancements in treatment, a definitive cure remains elusive. Current therapeutic strategies only slow down disease progression, inhibiting abnormal blood vessels growth, and preserving or improving vision. Among these strategies, photodynamic therapy (PDT) has emerged as a promising treatment, particularly for neovascular form, the most severe form of the disease. Although several photosensitizers (PS) have been developed, only one has received clinical approval for use in AMD. This treatment involves the intravenous administration of a photosensitizing agent that preferentially accumulates in the abnormal blood vessels beneath the macula. Upon activation by targeted laser light, the PS triggers photochemical reactions, leading to vascular occlusion and the reduction of choroidal neovascularization. This review provides a comprehensive overview of both experimental and clinical studies on PDT for AMD, discussing the current state of research, challenges in treatment optimization, and potential future directions to enhance this therapeutic approach.-",0.5245,NEGATIVE,0.9697

2024-11-24,Prof. Ryan McGowan,"Professor of Business, Banking, Finance & Economics University of Applied Sciences - EU / Qualified Wealth Manager","1,000 days ago after 8 years of Ukrainian broken peace agreements that your colleague in the previous EU state of Germany Merkel (now kaput after the self harming sanctions destroyed it) admitted the Minsk 1 & 2 agreements were a sham to give the Kiev regime time to build up it's armed forces and recruit the Fascist Wolfs Angle Variant Swaztika wearing (from the Waffen SS 2nd Division Panzerlied Das Reich), the Russian Federation (part of the NATO Russia Military Alliance at that time), sent in a small force of 90,000 military personnel amd then another 100,000 to help the 60,000 freedom fighters in the Donbas who wrw upholding international law (equality before the law, right to resist and self defence, etc, etc, etc) this was small and reasonably limited Special Military Operation as no declaration of war eas made and not one military personnel was mobilised (NATO News Networks refer to the calling up of part time 300,000 Military Reserve Personnel for full time active duty 'Mobilisation', you can't be mobilised into thr armed forces if your already part of it twits?). However, under the UN Charter on Fundamental Rights every state has the ""Responsibility to Protect"" its citizens anywhere in the world. Many UN states cannot fulfil this duty. Russia the world's largest land forces & nuclear power and worlds 2nd largest Air and Naval power can when it's citizens suffering massacres and crimes against humanity by a regime that ended it's legal basis for independence and sovereignty by trying and failing to join NATO breaking its legal requirement to be neutral under international law can do so.  Germans, especially unelected leaders which is the definition of a dictator seems to never learn. But as a wise German who could learn once pointed out,  ""If we learn anything from history, it is that humans can learn nothing from history""  I think as a German he was speaking about the so-called Herren-Volke. Now NATO forces have invaded Russia and attacked them with short range missiles, I imagine it will take the Russians to do what they and their former USSR compatriots in the Ukrainian SSR did and go all the way to Berlin again, but this time on to the Rhine.  Thank God the EU state of the Republic of Ireland still under partial UK led NATO occupation, like the EU state of the Republic of Cyprus (currently occupied by both UK & Turkey, although Turkey wisely wants to join the Russian led BRICS+), has nothing to do with this revanchist rubbish. all those who advocate war must either serve on the front line or if too old and frail like Furherline VDL they must have their children in the front row! End Anglo American Fascist Zionist NATO Axis Occupation of Western Europe.  The USA (1st in NATO command) is not even in Europe, never mind the Euro, EU? While the UK (2nd in NATO command), is not in the Euro, EU or even EFTA either.  The Former Russian SFSR & Ukrainian SSR are also not in the Euro, EU, EFTA or NATO?  Germany will learn its last lesson soonüçÄ",0.5149,NEGATIVE,1.0

Hardware performance is critical. Y's Modern CPUs have evolved to help make AI performant for the RAN. The modern CPUs include several features that accelerate AI models. These include Vector Extensions for , support for lower precision calculations for faster AI training and inference, Matrix Extensions etc.  Y's modern CPUs support Layer 1&2 functions as well as efficiently run the AI models to achieve a robust AI-for-RAN realisation.    Y's partner Vendor-X, a founding member of AI-RAN Alliance, has developed embedded for multiple NR signal processing algorithms with a precisely designed deep neural network ( ).  Y and X have collaborated to bring this transformational AI software to market as part of the Y's (Y1) software suite.  X's 5G AI embedded software provides DNN-based physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH) channel estimation routines (for standard MIMO), and SRS channel estimation and pre-coding routines (for ). X's 5G AI software components can be leveraged by existing customers of Y1 suite without additional hardware or software stack changes.  By using for L1 processing, less compute is required to process the uplink (PUSCH) signals in standard MIMO configurations, increasing the number of sectors per server and reducing their cost of operation.  The ML-driven L1 processing improves SINR that enables increased throughput and coverage, optimizing the value and utilization of costly spectrum licenses and band allocations. SINR improvements can also enable bandwidth increases, reduced user traffic latency, and a smaller interference margin for cell planning.    To help developers take advantage of Y's modern CPUs, Y has a strong software support for developer ecosystem.  Y has released optimized libraries, such as Y's Deep Neural Network Library, Math Kernel Library, and AI & Data Analytics Library etc.  Tragedy is Y has not joined the AI-RAN Alliance.  ‚ñ™Ô∏è Divide & Rule  N is a founding member of AI-RAN Alliance and there is a fierce historic rivalry between N and Y, but still both are deeply committed to unlock AI's potential for / .

This method not only provides real-time insights but also supports long-term nuclear non-proliferation goals, ensuring that nations can monitor and maintain nuclear arsenals without resorting to destructive testing.  üìå Ethical and Political Dimensions  While nuclear simulations offer a path forward in the absence of physical testing, they also raise important ethical and political questions. The CTBT was designed not only to prevent the development of new nuclear weapons but also to limit the further proliferation of nuclear capabilities. The reliance on simulation, however, could allow countries to continue to enhance their nuclear stockpiles under the radar, potentially undermining the spirit of disarmament efforts.  Additionally, the technological advancements that enable such simulations also bring concerns related to arms races, with countries possibly engaging in a competitive development of more advanced weapons under the guise of maintaining or improving existing arsenals.

But soon after we complete task ,they will say they gonna send the payment but at the last moment they will say our ID is not registered amd asks for $50 or couple of amount in order to receive payment.  the most skeptical thing is ,where you complete the task worth $20-$30 but the company will say that they will send around $1500 t0 $2000 and ask for a non refundable registration or of $50 which tottaly doesn't make sense.  a lot of people has fallen in this trap ,amd the worst part is we won't be able to to cyber complaint since it's a small amount but as per the engagement on post,we can clearly see that there are large number of victims who got scammed.  so here we wasted our time by completing the task and not even get paid.i would like to request to all of you for a help to stop this scam. atleast we can help people who got scammed and return their money.the numbers of scammed person are increasing day by day .

That same year, I recommended investors buy the dip in an up-and-coming chipmaker called Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). A few years later, AMD stock had soared more than 8,000%. I was also able to do this in 2018, when the market was crashing due to the Fed‚Äôs aggressive rate hikes. In the midst of that crash, I recommended investors buy the dip in tech stocks like The Trade Desk (TTD), Roku (ROKU), and Tesla (TSLA).

It would likely require over 500 pages to fully understand.For centuries, scientists have developed, tested, and validated the laws of the physical world, known as classical mechanics. These scientifically explain how and why things work, where they come from, so on and so forth.But in 1897, J.J. Thomson discovered the electron. And he unveiled a new, subatomic world of super-small things that didn‚Äôt obey the laws of classical mechanics‚Ä¶ at all. Instead, they obeyed their own set of rules, which have since become known as quantum mechanics.The rules of quantum mechanics differ from that of classical mechanics in two very weird, almost-magical ways.

2024-11-24,Jairo do,--,"üíª The Evolution of Chips: Where Are We Heading? Chips are the unsung heroes of our digital age. From powering smartphones to enabling breakthroughs in AI, semiconductors are the foundation of nearly every technology we depend on. As someone who‚Äôs deeply invested in this space, I wanted to share some thoughts on where I see the future of chips heading‚Äîand why it‚Äôs such an exciting time to be part of this industry. üìà Key Trends Shaping the Chip Industry 1Ô∏è‚É£ The Shift to Advanced Packaging and Chiplets The days of monolithic chips are fading. Advanced packaging technologies, like chiplets and 3D stacking, are allowing us to integrate different functionalities into a single package, increasing performance and flexibility. Companies like AMD and Intel are leading the charge, and it‚Äôs only the beginning. 2Ô∏è‚É£ The AI Revolution Needs New Silicon Generative AI, large language models, and edge computing are driving demand for specialized silicon. GPUs, TPUs, and custom AI accelerators are being optimized for massive parallel processing and energy efficiency. The race to deliver chips tailored for AI workloads is heating up. 3Ô∏è‚É£ Beyond Silicon: The Rise of New Materials As we approach the physical limits of silicon, the industry is exploring alternatives like gallium nitride (GaN), silicon carbide (SiC), and graphene. These materials could unlock higher performance and energy efficiency for applications like 5G, EVs, and space tech. 4Ô∏è‚É£ Sustainability in Manufacturing Chip production is energy- and resource-intensive. To stay competitive, manufacturers are focusing on green manufacturing processes, water recycling, and transitioning to renewable energy. The industry‚Äôs future depends on balancing innovation with sustainability. 5Ô∏è‚É£ Geopolitics and Supply Chain Resilience Recent years have exposed the vulnerabilities of the global semiconductor supply chain. Governments and companies are responding by investing in domestic production and reducing reliance on single-region manufacturing hubs. The CHIPS Act in the U.S. is just one example of this shift. Chips aren‚Äôt just about computing‚Äîthey‚Äôre about enabling the future. The devices we use, the data we process, and the experiences we create all depend on advancements in semiconductor technology. As someone working in this field, I‚Äôm inspired by the challenges and opportunities ahead. Whether it‚Äôs optimizing performance for AI models, solving supply chain issues, or driving sustainable production, this industry is at the heart of global innovation.",0.5363,POSITIVE,0.9991

2024-11-24,Aditya Raj,Cloud | Linux | Kubernetes | Docker | Security & Networking | C++ Enthusiast,"What Are Meltdown and Spectre Vulnerabilities? In 2018, two major vulnerabilities shook the tech world: Meltdown and Spectre. These flaws were found in modern processors (like Intel, AMD, and ARM) and impacted almost all devices‚Äîcomputers, servers, and smartphones. What Went Wrong? Modern processors use a feature called speculative execution to boost speed by predicting tasks. Hackers found a way to exploit this and access sensitive data like passwords and encryption keys. Meltdown: Hackers could directly access the CPU‚Äôs restricted memory, which should be private to the system. Think of it as someone unlocking a staff-only room and stealing confidential files. Spectre: Hackers could trick applications into revealing their private data. It‚Äôs like peeking into someone else‚Äôs notebook without them knowing. Why Does This Matter? Widespread Impact: Almost all devices with modern processors were affected. Sensitive Data Leaks: Passwords, encryption keys, and personal data were at risk. Stealthy: These vulnerabilities were hard to detect. What Was Done to Fix It? Software Updates were released to patch these flaws. New Processor Designs now make speculative execution more secure. The Lesson: Even the most advanced systems can have flaws. Regular updates and better security practices are crucial for protecting our devices.",0.5208,NEGATIVE,0.9993

Lemonade Secures ‚Ç¨12M Funding üí∞ Once again, the fintech scene shines as Lemonade grabs ‚Ç¨12M in funding. Investors are betting big on brokerage-as-a-service! But will this frenzy distract from the core issues like inclusivity in finance? Are we seeing a bubble forming in fintech that could burst?  4. Exein‚Äôs Cybersecurity Milestone üîê Rome-based Exein has secured ‚Ç¨15M in Series B funding for cybersecurity. Investments are flowing into critical areas like security‚Äîwhich is encouraging.

2024-11-24,Frederic Hamon,Chirurgien ophtalmologiste specialis√© en Retine,"Question is still, alas , if a cheap treatment could interest a lot of people, comparing to the lot of money expected with new expansive treatments ? Perhaps mainly the patients ? ‚ÄúFor patients battling the relentless advance of geographic atrophy (GA), a severe form of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), 2023 marked a game-changing moment as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) greenlit not one, but two revolutionary treatments: pegcetacoplan injection (SYFOVRE) and avacincaptad pegol (IZERVAY).  => However, despite these agents achieving the first FDA approvals, they may not have marked the completion of the GA treatment journey. Although designed to halt the progression of GA, both pegcetacoplan and avacincaptad pegol fall short of preventing the disease or improving a patient‚Äôs visual acuity +++ (‚Ä¶) Beyond its primary use as an anti-diabetic medication, metformin has been linked to anti-aging and neuroprotective properties. (‚Ä¶) As AMD is a disease of the retina, and if indeed, metformin has anti-aging properties, it can also affect macular degeneration,‚Äù Dimitra Skondra , MD, PhD, an associate professor of ophthalmology and visual science at University of Chicago , told HCPLive. ‚ÄúThat will be an attractive candidate because it‚Äôs a non-invasive way that can be used for a more preventive intervention before people go to the advanced stages and more targeted interventions are needed.‚Äù (‚Ä¶) In the search for alternative agents to treat GA, metformin is an attractive candidate, not just for its well-tested nature in diabetes, but also for an impressive clinical data set for AMD. Multiple observational studies have reported a protective effect of metformin against the likelihood of AMD development, including dry AMD. (‚Ä¶) => in Skondra‚Äôs view, metformin could already slot into the treatment armamentarium as an early-stage treatment, working to delay the progression to GA in a non-invasive matter.Given this promising evidence base, Skondra urged the need for a prospective clinical trial before wider implementation of metformin for GA.  ‚Äú[Metformin‚Äôs] almost the perfect candidate for a non-invasive strategy to target patients when they‚Äôre earlier in the disease stage,‚Äù Skondra said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs safe, affordable, and may help delay the process until they go to advanced stages of wet AMD or GA in particular.‚Äù",0.5276,NEGATIVE,0.9964

11/22/2024,Roger Behr,Interim Manager / General & Lean Supply Chain Management,"Nvidia: the most valuable company in the world! (Nov 21, 2024) The release of Q3 FY25 quarterly figures shows that Nvidia is continuing its formidable growth trend. Nvidia shares have risen up almost 200% in 2024 and up to 1000% in the last 2 years, making Nvidia the most valuable company in the world with a market cap of $3.6 trillion (Apple $3.45 trillion). Nvidia even reached a new all-time high today.  Although the company has struggled to keep up with demand and faced production difficulties this year, no other chipmaker managed to take market share from Nvidia. Its revenue is on track to double for the second year in a row, generating more money in gross profit than it used to generate in revenue, thanks to a 75% gross profit margin.  Nvidia's data center division now generates more revenue than its two closest competitors, Intel and AMD, combined.  Nvidia's flagship product is its AI (accelerator) chip, which facilitates the development of artificial intelligence models by processing massive amounts of data. Since OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT launch in 2022, a rush for AI services has generated insatiable demand for such chips.  Major Nvidia customers such as Microsoft, Amazon‚Äôs AWS and Meta have reiterated their willingness to invest in AI infrastructure, although few have actually made that spending so far.  The company hopes to stay ahead of its rivals by accelerating the pace of innovation. This requires a commitment to update the product line annually. Nvidia is currently introducing Blackwell, a graphics processing unit (GPU) microarchitecture, which is faster and offers improved ability to interface with other chips. This innovation is expected to impact results early next year, although production challenges have delayed its launch. For now, Nvidia can‚Äôt keep up with all incoming orders, according to CEO, Jensen Huang. He is confident that once production improves, supplies will be plentiful, assuming that no faster and cheaper chips have been brought to market by competitors in the meantime.  However, investor enthusiasm for artificial intelligence may be outpacing reality. There seems to be a rotation in the stock markets from mega-caps to mid-caps. And by the way, Bitcoin is aiming for $100,000 with a market cap of almost $2 trillion.",0.5739,POSITIVE,0.7433

However, Wall Street's focus shifted to Nvidia's Q4 forecast, which, while exceeding average analyst expectations of $37.1 billion with a projection of $37.5 billion, fell short of the loftiest estimates of $41 billion. This tempered some of the AI-fueled enthusiasm around the company. Despite production delays for its new Blackwell chips and supply constraints, Nvidia's growth remains remarkable, driven by insatiable demand for its AI accelerator chips from industry giants like Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta. CEO Jensen Huang underscored the company's commitment to annual innovation and the transformative potential of AI across industries. Although manufacturing hurdles are slowing progress, Nvidia's dominance in AI hardware remains unshaken, even as cautious investors pushed shares down 4%.  My Take  Nvidia‚Äôs tempered outlook for Q4 reflects the natural ebb in hype cycles but underscores the company‚Äôs operational bottlenecks more than market saturation. Its commitment to annual innovation, demonstrated by Blackwell, is an ambitious strategy to maintain dominance, though it risks stretching supply chains thin.

The PS5 Pro is the much-anticipated upgrade to Sony‚Äôs PlayStation 5, and one of the most exciting features rumored to accompany it is enhanced ray tracing support. Since the launch of the PS5, ray tracing has been a game-changer, making graphics look more realistic by simulating the behavior of light with unprecedented accuracy. Games that support ray tracing can display highly realistic reflections, shadows, and lighting effects, creating a visually immersive experience. But as games become more demanding, there‚Äôs always room for improvement in hardware performance, and the PS5 Pro is anticipated to take ray tracing to the next level.  This article explores whether the PS5 Pro will indeed offer improved ray tracing capabilities, how it might achieve this, and what it could mean for gamers. In doing so, we'll look at the advancements in hardware that are anticipated, the role of ray tracing in modern gaming, and how Sony could leverage new technologies to stay competitive in a market where visual fidelity is becoming a major selling point.  What is Ray Tracing?  Ray tracing is a rendering technique that produces incredibly lifelike lighting effects by tracing the path of light as it interacts with objects in a scene. Traditional rendering methods, like rasterization, approximate light to save processing power, which can sometimes produce less realistic results. In contrast, ray tracing calculates how light interacts with surfaces, including how it reflects, refracts, or absorbs on various materials. This approach has been widely adopted in the film industry for CGI, but its application in real-time video games has only become feasible with the recent generation of gaming consoles and GPUs.  While the PS5 supports ray tracing, it comes at a cost in terms of performance, often requiring games to run at lower frame rates or resolutions to accommodate this demanding feature.

Who doesn't love a good game? To be honest, sometimes I really don‚Äôt. With the computer power that is needed recently to open up a game, it‚Äôs up to chances whether I can play any games. That is why the recent announcement of AI upscaling on PS5 Pro, called PSSR.  This is not actually new as others have already introduced this kind of upscaling, like FSR by AMD, DLSS by NVIDIA, with both striving to run games at a lower resolution and upscaling them.  While DLSS uses AI and specialized hardware for detailed upscaling, FSR mainly tries to upscale games without any hardware to support so the results may be worse.  PSSR, or PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution, is Sony‚Äôs answer to NVIDIA and AMD. Supposedly it also takes advantage of machine learning hardware to upscale the games and has been trained on various games owned by Sony. So far, the results have been quite good as it may not be able to compete with Nvidia‚Äôs DLSS, it is handily beating FSR. I‚Äôm quietly optimistic about this tech as its implementation might be limited.  Here‚Äôs hoping for a future 8k-capable gaming console from Sony.",0.5296,NEGATIVE,0.9928

Here are a few common ones:  ‚ùå Myth 1: Intel is always faster than AMD ‚úÖ Fact: This myth stems from Intel‚Äôs dominance in single-threaded performance in the past. However, the AMD Ryzen CPUs have shown competitive or even superior single-threaded performance compared to Intel‚Äôs offering.

Their Ryzen Pro series, for example, is designed specifically for business use, offering features like enhanced security and manageability  ‚ùå Myth 3: Intel CPUs are more reliable. ‚úÖ Fact: Both AMD and Intel produce reliable CPUs.

The most famous example is, which was almost sold to its competitor Excite for 750,000 dollars in 1999. Or, which wanted to take overfor almost one billion dollars. And of course there is also an anecdote about, currently one of the most highly valued companies in the world thanks to its AI chips. In 2006, chip manufacturerwanted to enter the graphics card industry and considered acquiring Nvidia. The deal fell through because Nvidia boss Jensen Huang and the then AMD CEO Hector Ruiz were unable to reach an agreement. AMD bought ATI instead.  Google, Meta and Nvidia are now among the most influential companies in the tech industry. Excite, on the other hand, no longer exists. Yahoo - now a mere shadow of its former self - is owned by the investment company Apollo Management. But AMD, which almost went bankrupt due to the high debt burden from the ATI purchase, has really blossomed under its current boss Lisa Su.  What's more, AMD, which, like Nvidia, has its headquarters in Santa Clara in Silicon Valley, has become Nvidia's most important competitor. AMD is the number 2 in the market for AI accelerators, ahead ofwith its Gaudi series and Google with Tensor, that is mainly used internally. The gap to Nvidia is, of course, huge. Nvidia's sales of AI accelerators are estimated at 105 billion dollars this year, while AMD will probably reach five billion dollars.  Now AMD boss Lisa Su is making a big purchase.

An explosion of growth in the artificial intelligence (AI) market highlighted the crucial role chipmakers have to play in the industry's development. As a result, companies like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) rallied and made for attractive ways to invest in the budding AI industry.  Yet AMD's stock is arguably the more compelling buy between the two. The company's market cap is currently $255 billion, compared to Nvidia's, which reached over $3 trillion this year. The considerable difference suggests AMD could have far more room to run than Nvidia in the coming years.  These companies are active in the same high-growth industries. Meanwhile, AMD is investing heavily into AI to catch up to its rival and is already seeing promising results, according to this latest earnings release.  So, here's why now is an excellent time to buy AMD stock before it's too late.  AMD's rivalry with Nvidia is heating up after a recent acquisition  Nvidia's business surged last year as its AI graphics processing units (GPUs) became the go-to for many developers worldwide. The chipmaker's success shed light on how far AMD fell behind in the industry, unable to immediately begin supplying its chips to AI-minded companies. However, AMD hastily worked to catch up, unveiling a line of AI GPUs that attracted prominent cloud companies like Microsoft's Azure, Meta Platforms, and Oracle.  Meanwhile, a Reuters report from Aug. 19 revealed AMD is bolstering its competitive edge by acquiring server maker ZT Systems for $5 billion. The move will expand AMD's access to powerful AI chips and hardware, strengthening its position against Nvidia. Training AI models requires intensive workloads, combining thousands of chips to power massive server systems. ZT Systems should help AMD do this more efficiently, allowing it to release its latest AI GPUs more quickly at a scale necessary for cloud platforms like Azure.  ""The main way (ZT Systems) is additive to the company is we sell more GPUs,"" AMD CEO Lisa Su said. AMD expects the purchase to positively affect its earnings as early as the end of 2025.  A new acquisition that will expand AMD's AI chip output strengthens the bullish argument for its stock. One of the biggest differences between AMD and Nvidia is the scale of their businesses, suggesting this is a step in the right direction.  A diversified business model that exposes investors to multiple areas of tech  Data from Grand View Research shows the AI market hit nearly $200 billion last year and is on track to reach just under $2 trillion by 2030. As a result, it's no surprise that AMD dove head-first into the industry.

The two main types are:  1. Dry AMD: The more prevalent form, characterized by gradual thinning of the macula and the formation of drusen, small yellow deposits that accumulate under the retina.  2. Wet AMD: This form is less common but more severe, involving the development of abnormal blood vessels that can leak fluid and blood, causing rapid vision loss.  Symptoms of AMD may include:  ‚ú≥Ô∏èBlurred or distorted central vision ‚ú≥Ô∏èDifficulty seeing in low light or at night ‚ú≥Ô∏èStraight lines appearing wavy or distorted ‚ú≥Ô∏èDark spots or a blank area in the central vision  Risk factors for AMD include:  üü¢Age (most common in those over 50) üü¢ Family history of the disease üü¢Smoking üü¢Obesity üü¢High blood pressure üü¢Poor dietary habits üü¢Prolonged exposure to sunlight  While there is currently no for AMD, several treatments can help manage the condition, particularly for wet AMD:  1.

AMD use the same underlying x86 technology in their chips, but software sometimes must be tweaked to work across their offerings. Intel and AMD now intend to change that with a new ""Advisory Group.""  Read -  The group will seek technical input for ""essential functions and features"" for chips from Intel and AMD with a goal to enhance customer choice and simplify architectural guidelines for enhanced software consistency and interfaces on x86 product offerings from Intel and AMD.  ‚ñ™Ô∏èThe Angle  To provide choices to Telcos the vendor needs to sure it's vDU software/solution is truly multiplatform.  This is an ongoing challenge for the industry struggling to build and deploy portable RAN software running across multiple accelerated computing platforms.  When a vendor says its CloudRAN can go on any hardware or cloud, there are always caveats.  For example, a vendor N's CloudRAN may have as an integral part a ""Smart"" PCIe card powered by it's custom SoC that runs vendor's proprietary L1 acceleration algorithms which are not portable to other computing architectures. The vendor in this case will highlight it's portability across Intel/AMD/AWS/NVIDIA etc. but that is only for the L2+ portion of it's CloudRAN.  Another vendor E's CloudRAN doesn't depend on a ""Smart"" PCIe card with custom SoC. It's L1 acceleration software however still depends on the Intel x86 Xeons CPUs and the vendor has tweaked it to work on AMD's chips as well. However, there is no word yet on support for any ARM-based option.  After Q3 results, the shares of E have hit a two-year high after it saw sales in North America growing 55% y-o-y, most likely due to modernization deal as there is nothing that suggests Verizon or T-Mobile have boosted spending.  ‚ñ™Ô∏è Rumours of Vendor N's death are severely exaggerated too, just like Intel's  A vendor S was rumoured as a potential buyer of N's RAN business, but it turned out to be fake. S is going through it's own rough patch with layoffs and everything. It's vRAN contract with Verizon runs till 2025e.  A sincere advice to N would be to 'let bygones be bygones' and port vDU L1 on Intel Xeons. This is THE key to making a comeback in US story, especially in VZ first and later in AT&T when it scales CloudRAN in 2027.",0.547,NEGATIVE,0.9996

2024-10-16,Maelien Goarin,Actualit√©s & Tendances qui captivent me monde,"Un v√©ritable tremblement de terre a secou√© Wall Street ce mardi, avec l‚Äôeffondrement des valeurs phares du secteur des semi-conducteurs. Des g√©ants comme Nvidia, AMD ou encore Broadcom ont vu leur cours de Bourse d√©gringoler, entra√Ænant dans leur sillage les principaux indices am√©ricains. Le Dow Jones a perdu 0,75%, le Nasdaq 1,01% et le S&P 500 0,76%. Mais quelles sont les causes profondes de cette d√©gringolade ? Lire la suite  L‚Äôalerte d‚ÄôASML, le premier domino  Tout a commenc√© avec l‚Äôavertissement sur r√©sultats d‚ÄôASML, le g√©ant n√©erlandais qui fournit des machines indispensables √† la production des puces les plus avanc√©es. Selon des sources proches du dossier, si la demande li√©e √† l‚Äôintelligence artificielle reste forte, d‚Äôautres segments du march√© des semi-conducteurs marquent le pas, notamment en Chine. Cette annonce a eu l‚Äôeffet d‚Äôune bombe, faisant craindre un ralentissement plus global du secteur.  La demande n‚Äôest pas aussi soutenue que pr√©vu dans certains segments du march√© des semi-conducteurs.  ‚Äì Un porte-parole d‚ÄôASML  Nvidia et AMD touch√©s de plein fouet  Les mastodontes am√©ricains Nvidia et AMD ont imm√©diatement accus√© le coup en Bourse, avec des chutes respectives de 4,69% et 5,22%. Il faut dire que ces entreprises sont en premi√®re ligne sur le march√© des puces pour l‚ÄôIA et le cloud computing, des secteurs en plein boom mais qui pourraient p√¢tir d‚Äôun ralentissement plus global. Des inqui√©tudes renforc√©es par des rumeurs selon lesquelles le gouvernement am√©ricain pourrait restreindre les exportations de certaines puces vers le Moyen-Orient, de peur qu‚Äôelles ne finissent en Chine.  Un effet domino sur tout le secteur tech  De Broadcom (-3,47%) √† Texas Instruments (-4,22%) en passant par Micron (-3,71%), c‚Äôest tout le secteur des semi-conducteurs qui a √©t√© entra√Æn√© dans la spirale baissi√®re. Et par ricochet, l‚Äôensemble du compartiment technologique, tr√®s d√©pendant des puces √©lectroniques, a souffert. Il faut dire que depuis deux ans, les valeurs tech surfent sur la vague de la digitalisation acc√©l√©r√©e par le Covid, dont l‚ÄôIA et le cloud sont des moteurs essentiels. Un ralentissement de la croissance dans les semi-conducteurs pourrait remettre en cause ce sc√©nario.  Des r√©sultats solides pass√©s au second plan  Paradoxalement, les bons r√©sultats publi√©s par de nombreuses entreprises sont pass√©s au second plan. Goldman Sachs, Bank of America ou encore Johnson & Johnson ont toutes d√©pass√© les attentes, mais cela n‚Äôa pas suffi √† enrayer la dynamique n√©gative impuls√©e par les semi-conducteurs. Preuve que les craintes sur la croissance future p√®sent plus lourd, aux yeux des investisseurs, que les performances pass√©es.  Le march√© a √©t√© distrait par la saga des semi-conducteurs, √©clipsant de bons r√©sultats par ailleurs.  ‚Äì Quincy Krosby, strat√©giste chez LPL Financial  Une consolidation salutaire ?

A note on how Intel missed the AI opportunity and didn't cope with change. Similar story brewing for Apple?  The creator of Silicon Valley, Intel recently lost a $30 Billion deal to provide chips to Sony Playstation to AMD.  This loss also puts a dent in CEO Pat Gelsinger‚Äôs turnaround plan for the company. They wanted to create a foundry unit. They had officially entered into contract manufacturing in February 2024.  This deal fell through due to negotiations on profit margins. Months of negotiations, among C-level executives, and engineers all fell through.  This is not the end! The company recently planned to cut 7% of its workforce. They reported over $7 billion in operating losses in their manufacturing business.  Imagine this for a company started by the great Gordon Moore, who is known for Moore‚Äôs Law which states that ‚Äúcomputer chips would get faster and cheaper every 18 months.‚Äù  Nvidia, which was once a shadow of Intel has now outperformed it. So is the case with AMD. Both Nvidia and AMD have outperformed Intel by a huge margin on many fronts.  In 1998 Intel launched Xeon chips for servers, it was for servers that require more computing power. Its campaign of Intel Inside is to date one of the most successful marketing campaigns. Xeon even today has a 75% market share.  History often repeats itself in different ways. You don‚Äôt run businesses on cruise mode. You often have to look for new opportunities to expand. Intel didn‚Äôt.  Intel failed to see the rise of smartphones. It doesn't operate in the mobile phone chips market where Samsung, Qualcomm, and Mediatek operate. They couldn‚Äôt see the profits that they saw in PCs and servers.  Other than this, they failed to see the rise of Machine Learning and AI. Nvidia is now the hero over there with over 90% market share and is also one of the most valuable companies in the world.  The other thing where they failed was on the manufacturing front. It came very late into the manufacturing of chips. It‚Äôs only now that it is expanding and building factories for manufacturing.  Basically, Intel was a design company until now. Now, similar is the story for Apple yet not so haunting since it has over $100 billion of Free Cash Flows from its iPhone and has been on cruise mode for years.  It is still riding on Steve Jobs‚Äô inventions. Yep, even the smartwatch. Apple has been slowly developing its services business but doesn't have an AI application of its own, unlike Microsoft or Google. Apple doesn‚Äôt have cloud services either.  Therefore, Apple mostly relies on the free cash flow of iPhones. Smartwatches or their services business aren‚Äôt that big a thing yet.  The technology sector is known for its almost seismic shift that can upend even the mightiest.  Source: ET",0.5555,NEGATIVE,1.0

10/12/2024,Martijn Hamann,Co-Owner & Partner @ Endeit Capital | Growth Capital Investor in Future of Work / AI,"‚ÄúI am AI‚Äù That‚Äôs a bolt statement but very true for NVIDIA today. We started our 3rd day of the AI Innovation US trip 2024 with a visit at their impressive HQ in Silicon Valley.  The company is led by founder and CEO Jensen Huangwho has driven NVIDIA to a remarkable $70bn revenue run rate today driven by the AI industry‚Äôs insatiable demand for their fast GPUs. However, it‚Äôs eventually not a race of compute speed (eg AMD vs NVIDIA), but about the machine learning performance. Forecasts expects AI will contribute $4.400 billion (!) impact across global GDP. Walking around and speaking with their VPs make me believe NVIDIA is just warming-up for an even bigger play into an ‚Äúall-you-can-eat AI‚Äù shop to ‚Äúdemocratize"" AI globally. What was also interesting to hear is their ‚ÄúNational AI program‚Äù based on supporting 1. AI R&D Initiatives, 2. Develop AI-Workforce, and 3. Developing an AI eco-system. They have allocated 40% of AI compute capacity to non-developed nations to enable a more Safe, Sustainable and Sovereignty world. NVIDIA‚Äôs Mission is to solve big global challenges like climate and healthcare where investments are very high.  The company remains remarkably agile via its ‚ÄúMission is the Boss‚Äù principle to solve those global problems amongst 30k FTEs, who each share monthly their top-5 things where they are working on, creating transparency and collaboration.  NVIDIA showed us their latest super chip at $10k, to be launched in 2025, called the Blackwell GB200, costed $10bn (!!) on R&D. It equals 1.700 laptop compute. The system is 30x faster than the previous architecture. Tesla and Meta have ordered rumored to be 700k chips, enabling their self driving car and metaverse aspirations.  We further spoke about the fast-accelerating transformative impact of AI across various industries today. The world is changing rapidly and jobs need rethinking. What does the ‚ÄúFuture of Work‚Äù mean? Most will be done by AI. 40% of time is wasted on low value, repetitive tasks and will soon be done by AI. That's positive, but has societal impact and requires re-skilling of large workforces.  Lastly, we spoke about NVIDIAs Corporate Venture arm which invested $1bn in ca 100 companies across AI ML, Robotics, Autonomous Machines and Metaverse Graphics. NVIDIA is also working a lot with startups, called NVIDIA Inception. Currently, the program supports 22.000 startups.  Finally, like in '22, '23 and now '24 we had another fascinating visit with our AI Innovation group of 20+ entrepreneurs where we saw this remarkable company is consistently innovating in technologies and services to solve the biggest problems on our planet. That‚Äôs quite a claim and goal, but you can see -aside from all the hardware successes- that NVIDIA is on a bigger and greater mission than I could have imagined a few years back.

While we scroll and create, we only sometimes think about the energy these clever machines need to get the job done!  With AI becoming our new go-to tool for everything from chat to art, the energy bill is starting to add up. Imagine every image being like your phone saying, ""Hey, I need a charge!""  So, what can we do? It's time to come together and advocate for greener AI and smarter tech and maybe‚Ä¶ hit 'send' a little less often. üòÖüåç  On the serious side, the rapid growth of AI, particularly generative AI, is driving a massive increase in power consumption. Big Tech companies are investing tens of billions quarterly in AI accelerators. This surge transforms power usage into a mission-critical challenge as companies like Nvidia, AMD, and Intel release next-generation AI accelerators that consume significantly more electricity with each iteration. For instance, Nvidia's A100 GPU consumes up to 400W, but its successor, the H100, consumes up to 700W‚Äîa 75% increase. Intel's Gaudi 3 accelerator will consume 900W, and its upcoming Falcon Shores hybrid processor is expected to use an astounding 1,500W per chip.  The demand for GPUs is increasing as data centre energy needs are rising rapidly. In 2023, Nvidia alone shipped 3.76 million GPUs, which is estimated to consume 14.38 TWh of power annually, equivalent to the energy usage of over 1.3 million U.S. households. These numbers are expected to increase further with the introduction of Nvidia's Blackwell generation and other AI accelerators. Big Tech's capital expenditures (capex) on AI infrastructure will exceed $200 billion in 2024, primarily for GPUs to power AI training and cloud services.  One of the critical challenges ahead is managing the growing energy consumption while maintaining performance. Although newer GPUs are becoming more power-efficient and delivering more performance per watt, AI systems' sheer scale and power demands are outpacing these efficiency gains. As a result, data centres increasingly shift to liquid cooling systems to handle the heat generated by these powerful processors.",0.5475,POSITIVE,0.9954

Performance with RTX 4050: The Nvidia RTX 4050 uses hardware acceleration with CUDA and OptiX, which can significantly speed up Cycles renders, especially when ray tracing is involved.  Best for: Photorealistic renders, high-quality animations, product visualizations, and any scene where accuracy and details are important.  Eevee: Speed: Eevee is a real-time rendering engine, which prioritizes speed over accuracy. It‚Äôs not as physically accurate as Cycles but can produce impressive results quickly.  Performance with RTX 4050: Eevee benefits from the RTX 4050‚Äôs fast processing power, giving smooth real-time previews and faster final renders.  Best for: Fast animations, scenes where real-time previews are needed, stylized renders, or when the project doesn‚Äôt require photorealism.  Use Cycles for high-quality, photorealistic results, taking advantage of the RTX 4050‚Äôs ray-tracing power. Use Eevee for faster renders, especially for stylized scenes or when time efficiency is a priority.

As to what parts they used, a full-fat NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 GPU and an AMD Ryzen 7950X3D.  The man took to the Chinese social media platform BiliBili to post his Franken-laptop for all to see, with all the components used in all its glory. To call their machine a ‚Äúlaptop‚Äù is a stretch and but in all fairness, this isn‚Äôt the first time a person has created such high-powered machines, with the goal of portability somewhat in mind.  (Image source: Bilibili.)  Getting back on, the components they used was a blower-style RTX 4090, the Ryzen 9 7950X3D, an ITX board, 32GB DDR5-6800 RAM, and a speaker system comprising two 20W tweeters plus woofer.  The end result is a system that is seemingly able to maintain its composure. Even in its unorthodox chassis, the RTX 4090 is able to reach and draw the full-fat 450W while staying within the 70¬∞C threshold.  (Image source: Bilibili.)  As for its size, the machine has a thickness of 7cm, so it can still fit inside a backpack. Now here‚Äôs the downside: it weighs approximately 7kg, meaning that unless you‚Äôre aiming to get swole or you‚Äôre doing weight training, you‚Äôre better off carrying this machine around using a dolly or a suitcase.

Once the undisputed king of chips, Intel's journey from predator to potential prey offers valuable insights into the dynamics of technological innovation and market leadership.  Intel's Golden Era  Founded in 1968 by Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore, Intel quickly established itself as a pioneer in the integrated circuit industry. The company's breakthrough came in 1971 with the introduction of the Intel 4004, the world's first commercial microprocessor. This innovation set the stage for Intel's dominance in the PC era.  The 1980s and 1990s saw Intel's fortunes soar alongside the booming personal computer industry. The company's processors, paired with Microsoft's Windows operating system, became the standard ""Wintel"" platform that powered the majority of PCs worldwide. This symbiotic relationship propelled Intel to the top of the semiconductor industry in 1993, a position it would hold for an impressive 24 years.  Shifting Sands in the Semiconductor Landscape  The semiconductor industry has undergone several major shifts over the past few decades:  1. 1986-1992: Japanese companies like NEC and Toshiba dominated, largely due to their leadership in DRAM technology.  2. 1993-2016: Intel reigned supreme, riding the wave of PC industry growth.  3. 2002-2016: Samsung emerged as a strong contender, capitalizing on the expanding memory market.  4. 2017-present: A period of flux, with Samsung, Intel, and most recently, NVIDIA, vying for the top spot.  Intel's Challenges and Missteps  Intel's decline from its dominant position can be attributed to several factors:  1. Missed opportunities in mobile: As smartphones took center stage, Intel failed to capitalize on this massive market shift.  2. Stagnation in core markets: Increased competition in PC and server CPU markets from rivals like AMD eroded Intel's market share.  3. Manufacturing setbacks: Delays in advancing to more efficient chip manufacturing processes allowed competitors to catch up and even surpass Intel's capabilities.  4. Conservative leadership: The tenure of CEO Bob Swan (2019-2021) was marked by cautious financial management rather than bold technological investments.  5. Late entry into emerging markets: Intel has struggled to gain a foothold in growth areas like AI accelerators, where NVIDIA has established a commanding lead.  6.

Does this mean the other hardware GPU providers in the next year are going to eat away NVDIA's moat? Let me know your thoughts in comments.  Meanwhile here are some ideas to chew on from the Pytorch blog post: 1. The article discusses achieving FP16 inference with popular LLM models (Llama3-8B and IBM's Granite-8B Code) using 100% OpenAI's Triton Language computation.  2. Triton-based models achieved 0.76-0.78x performance relative to CUDA kernel workflows on Nvidia H100 GPUs, and 0.62-0.82x on Nvidia A100 GPUs.  3. Triton provides a path for enabling LLMs to run on different types of GPUs (NVIDIA, AMD, and potentially Intel) and offers a higher layer of abstraction in Python for GPU programming.  4. The article breaks down the core operations in a Transformer block, including RMSNorm, matrix multiplications, RoPE, attention, and activation functions.  5. To achieve 100% Triton inference, the authors replaced smaller ops with compiler-generated Triton kernels and more complex computations with handwritten Triton kernels.  6. A custom FP16 Triton GEMM kernel using SplitK work decomposition was developed for matrix multiplications in linear layers.  7. The authors evaluated various Triton flash attention kernels and chose the AMD flash attention kernel for its compatibility with torch.compile and ability to produce legible output.  8. End-to-end benchmarks showed that Triton models can achieve up to 78% of the performance of CUDA models on H100 and up to 82% on A100 GPUs.  9. Microbenchmarks revealed that Triton matmul kernels are 1.2-1.4x slower than CUDA, and AMD's Triton Flash Attention kernel is 1.6x slower than CUDA SDPA.  10. Future work includes exploring further optimizations for matmuls and flash attention, as well as investigating FP8 LLM inference using Triton kernels.

2024-10-16,Alok Tripathi,"| Technologist, Core, RAN, 5G, 6G, Cloud, AI |","""Rumours of my death are severely exaggerated. We are alive and well""   Intel's Pat Gelsinger also said, ""We see that the x86 architecture, this foundation of computing for decades, is about to go through a period of customization, expansion, scalability (with) the opportunities that AI will present, and our ecosystem is robust and growing."" -  ‚ñ™Ô∏èx86 Ecosystem Advisory Group  Intel invented the x86 computing architecture and AMD licenses the technology from Intel to make chips using x86, competing directly against Intel. AMD use the same underlying x86 technology in their chips, but software sometimes must be tweaked to work across their offerings. Intel and AMD now intend to change that with a new ""Advisory Group.""  Read -  The group will seek technical input for ""essential functions and features"" for chips from Intel and AMD with a goal to enhance customer choice and simplify architectural guidelines for enhanced software consistency and interfaces on x86 product offerings from Intel and AMD.  ‚ñ™Ô∏èThe Angle  To provide choices to Telcos the vendor needs to sure it's vDU software/solution is truly multiplatform.  This is an ongoing challenge for the industry struggling to build and deploy portable RAN software running across multiple accelerated computing platforms.  When a vendor says its CloudRAN can go on any hardware or cloud, there are always caveats.  For example, a vendor N's CloudRAN may have as an integral part a ""Smart"" PCIe card powered by it's custom SoC that runs vendor's proprietary L1 acceleration algorithms which are not portable to other computing architectures. The vendor in this case will highlight it's portability across Intel/AMD/AWS/NVIDIA etc. but that is only for the L2+ portion of it's CloudRAN.  Another vendor E's CloudRAN doesn't depend on a ""Smart"" PCIe card with custom SoC. It's L1 acceleration software however still depends on the Intel x86 Xeons CPUs and the vendor has tweaked it to work on AMD's chips as well. However, there is no word yet on support for any ARM-based option.  After Q3 results, the shares of E have hit a two-year high after it saw sales in North America growing 55% y-o-y, most likely due to modernization deal as there is nothing that suggests Verizon or T-Mobile have boosted spending.  ‚ñ™Ô∏è Rumours of Vendor N's death are severely exaggerated too, just like Intel's  A vendor S was rumoured as a potential buyer of N's RAN business, but it turned out to be fake. S is going through it's own rough patch with layoffs and everything. It's vRAN contract with Verizon runs till 2025e.  A sincere advice to N would be to 'let bygones be bygones' and port vDU L1 on Intel Xeons. This is THE key to making a comeback in US story, especially in VZ first and later in AT&T when it scales CloudRAN in 2027.",0.547,NEGATIVE,0.9996

So is the collaboration of Intel and AMD. This partnership could have several implications for Nvidia and the broader AI landscape: -With Intel and AMD focusing on improving their processors and potentially integrating more advanced AI features, they may become more competitive with Nvidia‚Äôs GPUs, which have dominated AI workloads now. The collaboration between Intel and AMD could introduce new dynamics in the industry, fostering competition that could accelerate innovation and lead to more options for developers and customers alike. -A strengthened x86 ecosystem could lead to more robust platforms for AI development. If Intel and AMD enhance their CPUs to better handle AI tasks, it might provide developers with more options beyond Nvidia‚Äôs GPUs, leading to a more diverse and competitive marketplace. -If the collaboration results in significant advancements in CPU performance for AI tasks, Nvidia could see pressure on its market share, especially in sectors where CPU-GPU integration becomes crucial for performance. -The group could drive new standards for AI processing on x86 platforms, creating an environment where Intel and AMD can leverage their combined strengths against Nvidia‚Äôs dominance in the GPU sector. -As Intel and AMD improve their hardware, there may be a corresponding push for software optimizations that better utilize their architectures.

2024-10-16,Maelien Goarin,Actualit√©s & Tendances qui captivent me monde,"Un v√©ritable tremblement de terre a secou√© Wall Street ce mardi, avec l‚Äôeffondrement des valeurs phares du secteur des semi-conducteurs. Des g√©ants comme Nvidia, AMD ou encore Broadcom ont vu leur cours de Bourse d√©gringoler, entra√Ænant dans leur sillage les principaux indices am√©ricains. Le Dow Jones a perdu 0,75%, le Nasdaq 1,01% et le S&P 500 0,76%. Mais quelles sont les causes profondes de cette d√©gringolade ? Lire la suite  L‚Äôalerte d‚ÄôASML, le premier domino  Tout a commenc√© avec l‚Äôavertissement sur r√©sultats d‚ÄôASML, le g√©ant n√©erlandais qui fournit des machines indispensables √† la production des puces les plus avanc√©es. Selon des sources proches du dossier, si la demande li√©e √† l‚Äôintelligence artificielle reste forte, d‚Äôautres segments du march√© des semi-conducteurs marquent le pas, notamment en Chine. Cette annonce a eu l‚Äôeffet d‚Äôune bombe, faisant craindre un ralentissement plus global du secteur.  La demande n‚Äôest pas aussi soutenue que pr√©vu dans certains segments du march√© des semi-conducteurs.  ‚Äì Un porte-parole d‚ÄôASML  Nvidia et AMD touch√©s de plein fouet  Les mastodontes am√©ricains Nvidia et AMD ont imm√©diatement accus√© le coup en Bourse, avec des chutes respectives de 4,69% et 5,22%. Il faut dire que ces entreprises sont en premi√®re ligne sur le march√© des puces pour l‚ÄôIA et le cloud computing, des secteurs en plein boom mais qui pourraient p√¢tir d‚Äôun ralentissement plus global. Des inqui√©tudes renforc√©es par des rumeurs selon lesquelles le gouvernement am√©ricain pourrait restreindre les exportations de certaines puces vers le Moyen-Orient, de peur qu‚Äôelles ne finissent en Chine.  Un effet domino sur tout le secteur tech  De Broadcom (-3,47%) √† Texas Instruments (-4,22%) en passant par Micron (-3,71%), c‚Äôest tout le secteur des semi-conducteurs qui a √©t√© entra√Æn√© dans la spirale baissi√®re. Et par ricochet, l‚Äôensemble du compartiment technologique, tr√®s d√©pendant des puces √©lectroniques, a souffert. Il faut dire que depuis deux ans, les valeurs tech surfent sur la vague de la digitalisation acc√©l√©r√©e par le Covid, dont l‚ÄôIA et le cloud sont des moteurs essentiels. Un ralentissement de la croissance dans les semi-conducteurs pourrait remettre en cause ce sc√©nario.  Des r√©sultats solides pass√©s au second plan  Paradoxalement, les bons r√©sultats publi√©s par de nombreuses entreprises sont pass√©s au second plan. Goldman Sachs, Bank of America ou encore Johnson & Johnson ont toutes d√©pass√© les attentes, mais cela n‚Äôa pas suffi √† enrayer la dynamique n√©gative impuls√©e par les semi-conducteurs. Preuve que les craintes sur la croissance future p√®sent plus lourd, aux yeux des investisseurs, que les performances pass√©es.

Model: Companies like NVIDIA and AMD focus on chip design while outsourcing manufacturing to firms like TSMC. This model allows for greater innovation and avoids heavy capital investments.  2.  Foundries such as TSMC and Samsung utilize advanced technologies for chip production. This capital-intensive segment is concentrated in geopolitically significant regions.  3. & Packaging Ensuring chip quality is critical, and companies like Teradyne and Amkor lead in testing and packaging, safeguarding functionality and durability.  4. Layer Key players like ASML and Applied Materials provide essential manufacturing equipment and materials, making them vital for semiconductor production.  5.

This strategy will help sustain TSMC's 3nm capacity utilization at a high level, with orders projected through the second half of 2026. Supermicro, however, declined to comment on rumors about its potential mobile chip launches.  There are indications that Supermicro's MI300 series processors, currently aimed at AI servers, may expand into mobile devices using TSMC's 3nm process. AMD has previously collaborated with Samsung on the Exynos 2200 processor, which featured AMD's RDNA 2 architecture. Should Supermicro's APU be integrated into Samsung smartphones, it would highlight Samsung's ongoing use of TSMC-manufactured chips.  AMD is expected to remain one of TSMC's top three customers this year, continuing to build its partnership with the company. The MI300 series will leverage TSMC's 5nm process and advanced technologies through its 3DFabric platform. Demand for TSMC's 3nm technology continues to rise, with major clients like Apple, AMD, MediaTek, and Qualcomm securing orders into 2026, despite TSMC tripling its production capacity for 3nm.  TSMC's N3E technology variant is set to begin mass production by the end of 2023, targeting AI accelerators, high-end smartphones, and data centers.

2024-11-26,Marius Pantea,Consulting Intermediary Agency Ltd,"üö® Cracks Emerge in Nvidia's AI Armor: What Should Investors Do? üö®  In recent weeks, Nvidia has been a shining star in the tech sector, primarily driven by explosive growth in AI demand and GPU sales. As businesses accelerate their digital transformation, Nvidia has positioned itself as the go-to provider for AI and data processing needs. However, recent reports indicate that not everything is as flawless as it seems.  Investor's Business Daily highlights emerging challenges for Nvidia as competition intensifies and market dynamics shift. While their leading technology and robust portfolio still make Nvidia a frontrunner, potential cracks are starting to show. Increased competition from companies such as AMD and Intel, along with potential regulatory scrutiny and market saturation, could pose significant risks to Nvidia's future growth.  For investors, this brings up an essential question: What should you do next?  1. **Stay Informed:** Continuous research is crucial. Look beyond stock performance and focus on industry trends, competitor movements, and potential market disruptions.  2. **Diversify Your Portfolio:** While Nvidia has been a strong performer, it‚Äôs wise to spread investments across multiple sectors. This strategy reduces risk and balances out potential losses in any single stock.  3. **Evaluate Long-Term Potential:** Short-term volatility is often a part of investing. Assess whether Nvidia‚Äôs fundamentals align with your long-term investment goals. If the company's growth story remains compelling, it may be worth holding or even buying on dips.  4. **Monitor Regulatory Developments:** As AI continues to gain traction, expect increased regulatory scrutiny. Investors should keep an eye on how these changes might impact Nvidia's business model and profitability.  5. **Engage in Discussion:** Share thoughts with fellow investors, analysts, and industry experts. Insights from different perspectives can help clarify the evolving landscape.  In conclusion, while Nvidia‚Äôs prospects are brighter than many, it‚Äôs crucial to recognize the cracks that are beginning to emerge. Staying informed, diversifying your investments, and keeping an eye on long-term potential will set you up for success amidst uncertainty.  What are your thoughts on Nvidia‚Äôs current position? Let‚Äôs discuss!  Source:"

2024-11-26,Nicholas Schaub,Associate Director of Artificial Intelligence,"A couple days ago I posted about Ask AIthena, an AI project that seeks to link all scientific and medical literature.  I forgot a very key piece of my post: the amazing team of scientists I work with to build it!andare the two man army working on ingesting and linking over 250 million scientific and medical texts.  What's better: we are building these tools fully open source and compatible with a variety of open source and private LLMs.  One of the key features we were showing off at supercomputing was that we can run the entire application in a framework agnostic way. We can deploy it locally without a GPU, on Apple silicon, NVidia GPUs (on the NCATS HPC), and on AMD GPUs (on Frontier at ORNL).  We have the overly ambitious goal of making this as easily accessible as possible, so that it is possible to use safely and securely for proprietary and healthcare research. By enabling researchers to use locally deployed LLMs, proprietary and private health information can be used with the system without concern of sending data to 3rd party systems.  These two gentlemen are absolute wizards to take on such a large endeavor, both in the context of the sheer volume of texts we are ingesting as well as the additional challenge of designing it to run everywhere.  I feel very privileged to work with such talented people, and because of them I think we are bringing science fiction to reality."
2024-11-26,Erudite Asia,"1,239 followers","TSMC‚Äôs expert on setting up factories in the U.S.: The U.S. still relies on chips ‚Äúmade in Taiwan‚Äù  American companies may continue to rely on TSMC's chips from Taiwan, despite TSMC's new factory in Arizona. The U.S. Department of Commerce has announced financial subsidies of up to $6.6 billion for TSMC's Arizona facility under the ""Chip Act,"" intended to create jobs and lessen U.S. dependence on Taiwanese chips. The Phoenix plant is projected to begin full production in early 2025.  While TSMC's Arizona facility will boost U.S. semiconductor production, it will not produce chips as advanced as those made in Taiwan. The Phoenix fab is set to manufacture 4-nanometer chips, while TSMC currently produces 3-nanometer chips in Taiwan. Further advancements, such as the upcoming 2-nanometer process, will not be matched by U.S. outputs for some time.  The Biden administration seeks to enhance domestic chip production while still relying on Taiwan. Major companies like NVIDIA, Apple, Qualcomm, and AMD are expected to continue sourcing chips from Taiwan. As TSMC focuses on research and development in Taiwan, it retains a competitive advantage in advanced technology, highlighting Taiwan‚Äôs critical role in the global semiconductor industry."

2024-11-29,Nandini Maheshwari,Student at Galgotias University,"Project 90: Moore Machine for even parity generator  hashtag #108rtlprojects  ‚ú® What is a Moore Machine?  A Moore machine is a subclass of FSM in which output is dependent solely on the present state. This characteristic makes it deterministic, well-suited for uses where expected functionality is of great importance.  üéØ Even Parity Generator  The idea sounds simple but is significant: the number of 1s in the succeeded binary sequence must be preserved as even; this is achieved by adding the appropriate parity bit. Here‚Äôs the Moore machine approach towards the issue:  States: Indicates if the sequence has even number or odd number of 1s.  Transitions: Event Occurrences defined by one or zero input bits.  Output: The output value is decided by the existing state making it a parity output generator.  üåü Applications  Generators of the parity type circuits like these are vital for the mechanisms of error detection and correction in data transfer and storage.  I am very grateful to my teammates,,,andfor their support and dedication throughout the project.

2024-11-29,Deepak gupta,Technical Author at TechShali,"Last Monday, the first images of this new generation were leaked through Amazon through the two models that ASRock plans to launch with 2 and 3 fans respectively and where all the specs.  Yesterday it appeared in Geekbench a performance test of the Intel Arc B580 with a performance that should be taken with a grain of salt and that, at first, does not seem like a good option for the most demanding users. Intel launched the Intel Arc range two years ago at a lower than normal price compared to NVIDIA and amd and, even so, it didn‚Äôt go well at all.  With the Intel Arc B580 Battlemage, the guys at Intel want to follow the same pricing strategy and according to the latest leak, it will be priced at only $250.  Price of the Intel Arc B580 Battlemage Intel‚Äôs second attempt to position itself in the graphics card market dominated with an iron fist by NVIDIA and with AMD with a minimal part of the pie, seems to follow the same pricing strategy. This new generation uses Xe2-HPG architecture to improve not only performance but also efficiency and includes, of course, improved support for ray tracing. The success of the Intel Arc B580, as with any graphics card or processor, not only depends on a good pricing strategy, but also on its performance and what the drivers are capable of offering.    Intel Arc B580 Limited Edition Graphics Box31P06HB0BA735858549271$250üòê  November 27, 2024 ‚Ä¢ 13:54     Once again, the source of this information comes from the X (Twitter) user momomo_us who has published various price screenshots from various websites. But, the most curious thing of all is that, as we can see in these images, there is talk of a limited edition. With that, we don‚Äôt know if it is a promotional launch version or if it is simply a commercial claim that is going nowhere. What do we know about the Intel Arc B580 The Intel Arc B580 will reach the mid-range market, it has 12 GB GDDR6 video memory and 20 Xe2 cores. This means 4 GB less memory and 4 cores than the previous generation, figures that should be compensated with the new architecture since, otherwise, it makes no sense for Intel to go down the path of efficiency instead of performance at the same time. What have you done with the new ones? Core Ultra 200 Series. Another aspect that also draws attention to this new generation of Intel graphics is that, for now, it seems that ASRock is the only manufacturer that wants to give Intel a new opportunity, at least based on the information we know so far. Regarding the release date, if we continue this pace of leaks, it is likely that tomorrow or at most Monday we will know.",0.543,NEGATIVE,1.0

2024-11-29,Andy Cheng,Operations Project Manager @ Lam Research | Ex-Foxconn | PMP,"From Underdog to Powerhouse: How Lisa Su Transformed AMD in a Decade  In just ten years, Lisa Su has orchestrated one of the most remarkable turnarounds in tech history, elevating AMD from a budget processor alternative to a formidable competitor in the x86 processor market.  The Challenging Landscape of 2014  When Su took the helm as CEO in 2014, AMD was at its lowest point. The company had been struggling for years, relegated to being a cheap alternative to Intel, with a processor architecture plagued by high power consumption and poor performance. Critical talent was leaving, including key architects like Jim Keller and Raja Koduri, casting further doubt on the company's future.  The Zen Revolution  Su's strategic masterstroke was the development of the Zen architecture, a complete redesign focusing on performance, efficiency, and scalability. Launched in 2017, Zen became the foundation for AMD's remarkable comeback. Successive iterations - Zen+, Zen 2, Zen 3, and Zen 4 - consistently improved processor performance, reduced power consumption, and increased core counts.  Market Transformation  The results have been nothing short of extraordinary:  - Desktop CPU market share rose from approximately 20% in 2014 to around 29% in 2024 - Server market share climbed from virtually zero to an impressive 24% - AMD's Ryzen and EPYC product lines have challenged Intel's long-standing dominance - $222B AMD market value in 2024  Breaking into New Territories  Beyond desktop and server markets, AMD has made significant strides in mobile computing and specialized markets. The Ryzen Mobile series and EPYC server processors have demonstrated the company's technological prowess and ability to innovate.  Ongoing Challenges  Despite remarkable success, AMD still faces challenges, particularly in:  - GPU performance, where NVIDIA maintains a strong lead - Mobile device market penetration - Developing comprehensive ecosystem support comparable to Intel's Evo platform  The Visionary Leader  Lisa Su's leadership has been characterized by:  - Bold strategic pivots - Commitment to engineering excellence - Long-term technological vision - Willingness to invest in groundbreaking architectures  Looking Forward  As of Q3 2024, Su confidently positions EPYC as the preferred CPU for modern data centers, highlighting AMD's continued potential for growth and innovation.  From an underdog to a serious contender, AMD's journey under Lisa Su's leadership is a testament to the power of strategic innovation and persistent technological development.

I joined via the Bluefish acquisition and immediately was amongst a team of rockstars ‚≠êÔ∏èthat created innovative usage based insurance solutions, smartsource PMO agreements and landed one of the first üí•smartfactory4.0 in Spain. We then moved into the heart ‚ù§Ô∏è of Vodafone Global Enterprise and I was privileged to be asked to run the Global Innovation Programme! üòäWorking with innovation teams across the world we were fortunate to ideate with top global Enterprise Customers and partners! Redesigningüßë‚Äçüíª digital transformation journeys, handling sophisticated cloud migration programmes and accelerating üìàinnovation through fintech and M-pesa expansions. We landed the first mobile private Network üèÜimplementation amd it was at that point I discovered Innovation could execute the corporate strategy! My journey üöóthen took me into the world of Vodafone Group Technology where we drove incubators to establish new platform business models. üí∏This gave rise to STEP ( safer transport Europe Platform) üöåenhancing road safety , digital asset broker ( pairpoint- sim trust blockchain for IOT) and Drones üöÅAPI strategy. We learnt to move at pace and scale utilising the three lenses of desirability, feasibility and viability! The Innovation Factory üöÄin partnership with Tomorrow Street & Accenture was born! We also had a lot of fun spending time in our customers shoes! Covid üéØhit the world hard but our Innovation factory moved to digital and helped our critical infrastructure customers to innovate üí°to operate. Focusing on ux design, prototyping, testing and cocreating on site with our customers during Covid is one of my most ‚ù§Ô∏èproudest career highlights! In 2023 my travels took me to VBUK and we joined the growth products together with Innovation. This drove real momentum for 5G slicing at Glastonbury, üé∏press and media events üé§at Downing Street and landed significant tech commercialisation in public sector initiatives, network as a Sensor capturing environmental data üåé, IT service management and understanding operational blueprints for AI and emerging tech. I have LOVED the people, the experiences and the innovation journey with customers around the world! I finally managed to get an IP registered this year and I truly hope it will help MNOS to monetise the way in which 5G will change the world of work. As I reflect üëÄon the past 10 years I realise work is an activity not a place you go! Big thank üí™you to all of My teams over the years you are all rockstars, global innovators üöÄchanging the world & customer who really shared their challenges and invited us in to redesign a better way of working x I‚Äôm truly thankful and excited about new beginnings!

2024-11-30,Academy of Management Discoveries,175 followers,"üí° Who really controls workplace technology?  We often see workplace technology as neutral‚Äîa tool shaped by how employees use it. But in reality, developers are at the center of a complex balancing act, navigating competing demands from high-powered managers, low-powered workers, and external stakeholders like policymakers, activists, and progressive employers. The challenge becomes even more complex because many developers work across multiple client organizations. This raises the question: How do developers influence workplace technologies and navigate these power dynamics?  A recentDiscoveries study by Jenna E. Myers uncovers two pathways through which developers of a digital manufacturing monitoring tool managed these tensions:  üöÄ Developers addressed cross-occupational differences by reconciling the conflicting needs of managers and workers, encoding workers' preferences into design prototypes. üöÄ When managers resisted features designed for workers, developers strategically limited managerial pushback and released inclusive updates.  Key takeaways- üåü Developers aren‚Äôt just technologists‚Äîthey‚Äôre power brokers. üåüBalancing stakeholder demands requires strategies that prioritize inclusivity without alienating decision-makers. üåüFuture research should explore how developers can challenge traditional managerial control while fostering equity across organizations.  The challenge ahead is: How do we empower technology architects to design tools that prioritize fairness and inclusivity in the workplace?

2024-11-30,Steven Wood,"Managing Director, Chief Operating Officer, Operations Director of over 30 years experience in the Food Manufacturing Industry","In  hashtag #leadership the ability to give ‚Ä¶. And take ‚Ä¶.effective feedback is one of the true differentiators between the best and the rest  On one side (giving) is a skill that requires a powerful combination of objectivity, empathy and precision. Whilst on the over (taking) requires us to be open, put the ego away, and be growth orientated. It also requires consideration of the environment and the mood of the other person in the equation  Typically we see a situation where all too often focus excessively on one form of feedback, without a balanced approach. We also see a world where leaders are reluctant to take feedback on themselves, as such having little visibility on how they are viewed by those around them  These two faults are hugely disengaging. To be excessively criticised or overly praised is of no benefit to anybody. Equally to have a leader who is not interested in receiving feedback means we simply look at them as robots with no care for the views of those around them  And yet - when we can get it right - it makes a huge difference. When a leader can balance their coaching and mentoring responsibilities and provide colleagues with intelligent, well meaning and constructive feedback we become hugely engaged and committed - we see a leader interested in our development as people and willing to put the time and effort into us  Equality when a leader is prepared to take feedback we see a fellow human being, trying to listen and get better as a person before they focus on those around them - we like to see vulnerability and accepting feedback is a genuine way makes us look and feel like human beings  It is therefore a balanced 4 way approach we are seeking to achieve in feedback which is captured in the attached infographic. The model we should aim for  - Advisory feedback - where we are given the benefit of experience amd knowledge relating to our challenges - Suggestive feedback - where we are offered options and choices to address our issues - Complimentary feedback where we are praised specifically for our role in outcomes - where we did well. - Critucal feedback where we assess situations and look for how we could have done better  All four forms of feedback have an important role to play. Both in the development of those around you - but also in the development of yourself. All should be absorbed and embraced for different reasons  When we can get the balance right and the quality of the feedback is based on specifics and examples, then it becomes a hugely powerful force for growth and development  Feedback is not something to be intimidated by, nor should it be used as a blunt instrument of control. It is to be embraced and invested in from a time and capability perepctive. It is ultimately the greatest way we can convey honesty and devotion at a one to one human level  When we accept that principle and then act upon it both in terms of what we do and supporting others we have the basis for growth and self development",0.523,NEGATIVE,0.645

The author thinks that Intel shoudl focus on IFS and not on X86 architecture. While only China could build up a Foundry competing with TSMC, the time has passed for the US and UE.  Intel's Board of Directors: A Catalyst for Decline  This paper provides a comprehensive examination of Intel's leadership issues, strategic missteps, and eroding market position.  ‚Ä¢ Board incompetence: 7 of 11 members lack relevant semiconductor experience ‚Ä¢ Cultural shift: From engineering focus to business-oriented management ‚Ä¢ Process technology failures: 10nm node debacle allowed competitors to gain market share ‚Ä¢ Erosion of x86 dominance: Rise of Arm-based processors in client and server markets  The authors trace Intel's problems to the appointment of Paul Otellini as CEO, marking a shift from technical leadership to business-oriented management. This change led to a cultural transformation that prioritized political power over technical excellence.  Intel's failure in developing its 10nm process node is identified as a critical turning point, enabling competitors like TSMC and AMD to gain significant market share. The paper also discusses the erosion of Intel's x86 moat in both client and server markets, with Arm-based processors and accelerated computing solutions posing significant threats.  The analysis extends to Intel's financial decisions, criticizing the focus on stock buybacks over capital expenditures during Bob Swan's tenure as CEO. This approach is described as malpractice in a capital-intensive industry when the company was losing market share and lagging in process technology.  The paper argues that Intel's board has made a series of poor decisions, culminating in the dismissal of Pat Gelsinger and a renewed focus on x86 products. The authors contend that this strategy is misguided and unlikely to address Intel's fundamental challenges.  Limitations of the study include potential bias in assessing board decisions and a focus on internal factors without fully exploring external market dynamics. The analysis may also underestimate the challenges faced by Arm-based processors in fully displacing x86 in certain markets.  This comprehensive analysis provides valuable insights into the challenges faced by established technology companies in maintaining market leadership and the critical role of board decisions in shaping a company's trajectory.",0.548,NEGATIVE,0.998

2024-12-13,Deepak gupta,Technical Author at TechShali,"MachineGames has already released the first patch for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle (you can see our analysis here), and since the game has been made available to users starting today we can say that it is the typical ‚Äúday one patch.‚Äù However, it has already become controversial due to the fact that it enables Path Tracing for users who have a graph of NVIDIAbut it leaves the holders of a graph of amd. Let‚Äôs explain it.   In fact, although we have already analyzed the new Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, it was because they gave us access to the game beforehand and that means that, what we were able to test it, we were not able to see such outstanding features as Path Tracing, which we It‚Äôs available right now. Well, that‚Äôs if we used an NVIDIA graphics card, of course‚Ä¶ Indiana Jones leaves AMD users without FSR As the developer explains in the patch notes‚ÄúAdded full ray tracing (Path Tracing) functionality for supported NVIDIA graphics cards. To use this function, a graphics card with a minimum of 12 GB of VRAM is required. ‚ÄúWe are also working to add support for AMD FSR in a future update.‚Äù Future update, you know, so for now nothing at all. As you can see in the video embedded above, the visual difference when using Path Tracing is quite interesting, especially in a game like this that supports ray tracing in shadows, reflections and even indirect lighting, settings that can be modified at will in the graphical options within the game. Of course, as you will surely realize if you watch this video, an RTX 4080 suffers quite a bit with all these settings activated, and the FPS drops to practically half.  This is one of the reasons why AMD users will be eagerly waiting for FSR technology to be implemented in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, since it is a way that, as we have seen on many other occasions, you can play with a high level of frames per second without giving up graphic quality, something that significantly improves the gaming experience‚Ä¶ and the truth is, having a fairly top graphics and then having to play at just over 30 FPS is quite unfortunate. This day 1 patch also fixes a good handful of issues and bugs from the preview version, which is the one we played, but it also adds some pretty interesting additional options, such as the ‚Äúreset values‚Äù option in the Options menu. In any case, practically everything in this patch is to solve problems detected in the initial version, which is why it is more than recommended that, whether you have an NVIDIA or AMD graphics card, you install it. And if your graphics card is AMD, then you will have to wait a little longer (probably a matter of one or two weeks) to be able to enjoy it properly.",0.53,NEGATIVE,1.0
2024-12-13,Joanne Woo,"Global VP, Division Head of Marketing & Communications at ABB | Curator, TEDxMelbourne","Lisa Su, CEO of AMD, has been named TIME's 2024 CEO of the Year, and it‚Äôs a well-earned recognition. Her story really resonates with me, and I wanted to share why I find her so inspiring.  Breaking barriers Born in Taiwan and raised in New York City, Lisa discovered her love for STEM early on, even building a hurricane simulator for a school project. She went on to earn a Ph.D. in electrical engineering at MIT, working her way through a male-dominated field to lead one of the most important companies in the world. Today, AMD is at the heart of the technology we use every day, from AI to supercomputing.  Turning AMD around When Lisa became CEO in 2014, AMD was struggling. Its stock was at $3, and people thought the company wouldn‚Äôt survive much longer. Under her leadership, AMD has not only survived but thrived, with its stock rising nearly 50-fold. She focused on rebuilding the company‚Äôs products, repairing customer relationships, and simplifying the business. It‚Äôs an incredible turnaround story.  Here's what I've learnt from reading about Lisa's leadership philosophy:  ‚Ä¢ Set big goals: She inspired her team by aiming high, like designing a CPU chip that was 40% faster than its predecessor.  ‚Ä¢ Focus and simplification matter: She rejected short-term distractions to double down on AMD's strengths, creating clarity and alignment across the organization.  ‚Ä¢ Be resilient: She balanced long-term goals with short-term wins to keep the company afloat while giving her team time to innovate.  ‚Ä¢ Invest in people: She‚Äôs known for building strong teams and holding everyone accountable, including herself.  Also, isn't it great to see an Asian American be recognized as CEO of the year? We need to see more diversity in leadership reporting, like this. As my Gen Alpha daughter would say: ""she slays!"".  I‚Äôm inspired by Lisa‚Äôs story of overcoming challenges to lead on a global stage. She‚Äôs shown that great leadership is about resilience, focus, and empowering others to do their best work.  Lisa‚Äôs story reminds me that leadership isn‚Äôt about being perfect - it‚Äôs about staying the course, making tough decisions, and inspiring people along the way. Congratulations to Lisa on this well-deserved honor.  What do you find most inspiring about Lisa‚Äôs story? I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts.  Read the article here:",0.553,POSITIVE,0.999

2024-12-14,Danielle Z,AI Computer Data Analysis Innovation Driver|Technology Leader|AI Solutions Director,"Liquid AI just raised $250M to develop a more efficient type of AI model Liquid AI, an AI startup co-founded by robotics luminary Daniela Rus, has raised $250 million in a Series A led by AMD. Per Bloomberg, the round values Liquid AI at over $2 billion. Liquid AI aims to build general-purpose AI systems powered by a relatively new type of AI model called a liquid neural network. Liquid neural networks consist of ‚Äúneurons‚Äù governed by equations that predict each individual neuron‚Äôs behavior over time. The ‚Äúliquid‚Äù bit in the term ‚Äúliquid neural networks‚Äù refers to the architecture‚Äôs flexibility; inspired by the ‚Äúbrains‚Äù of roundworms, not only are liquid neural networks much smaller than traditional AI models, but they require far less computing power to run.  Liquid AI aims to develop tailored liquid neural networks for applications like e-commerce, consumer electronics, and biotech. As part of AMD‚Äôs investment, Liquid AI says it‚Äôll work with the chipmaker to optimize its models for AMD‚Äôs GPUs, CPUs, and AI accelerators.",0.553,POSITIVE,0.794
