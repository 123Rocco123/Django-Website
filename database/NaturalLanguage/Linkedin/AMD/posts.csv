2024-11-24,Tarciana S.,"PhD, OMT | Doutora em Ciências (UNIFESP/EPM) ▪︎ Graduada em Tecnologia Oftálmica (UNIFESP/EPM).","📌Multi-omics technologies advance in molecular cell biology to understand and elucidate complexity of biological processes, especially when facing rare diseases and cell types. Modalities are continuously improving to advance in better therapeutic strategies related to disease markers and drug targets.  Above, the proof-of-concept study using multiomics data aimed to unravel age-related macular degeneration (AMD) pathophysiology.  Pathogenesis is still incompletely understood, but involves complement system (CS) activation and lipid dysregulation.  🚩Differential of this study: a systematic multiomics data integration analysis (genetics, metabolomics and proteomics) in the context of AMD!  ▪︎Setting: 155 cases of AMD (SIE study) -77 female (49.7%), 83 hypertensive (53.5%), 45 diabetic (29%).  In discussion, authors reported that among all the possible interactions between complement proteins and lipids, a significant one was found between sphingomyelin and C1R. The odds of AMD were 2 times higher for individuals with low levels of sphingomyelin and C1R.  Sphingolipids are known to be involved in the regulation of many physiological and pathophysiological processes in the retina. Moreover, homeostasis of different sphingolipids plays a role in the maintenance, progression, and regulation of the immune response.  Limitations? Yes! Limitations include population ethnicity, limited sample size, early and intermediate AMD were pooled in a single category.  😊Prognosis and hope: In future, precision health will aim to predict, prevent, and cure diseases more precisely by taking into account each individual’s genetics, environment, and lifestyle factors in contrast to the “one-size-fits all” and reactive approach of traditional medicine.  ℹ️Read more: ▪︎Interplay between Lipids and Complement Proteins—How Multiomics Data Integration Can Help Unravel Age-related Macular Degeneration Pathophysiology: A Proof-of-concept Study.

2024-11-24,tariq kanaan,Telecommunication System Engineer | Wireless Network Engineer | Electronic Engineering | Lectures | programmer |AI engineering | core engineering | optical communication,"post3 📈 The Evolution of Microprocessors: From Calculators to Artificial Intelligence 1970s: The Birth of Microprocessors and the Transistor Revolution The development of the transistor in 1947 led to a revolution in electronics, enabling the miniaturization of circuits and the creation of the first microprocessor: Intel’s 4004, released in 1971. This 4-bit chip, which contained 2,300 transistors, could perform basic arithmetic and control functions in calculators. This milestone marked the start of single-chip computing, a precursor to the programmable devices we rely on today. Other key processors from this period include Intel’s 8008, an 8-bit processor released in 1972, which introduced higher functionality for early computing devices. 1980s: The Rise of 16-Bit and 32-Bit Chips & the Era of Personal Computing With the progress of integrated circuits and advancements in reducing transistor sizes, 16-bit and later 32-bit processors entered the scene, delivering unprecedented power and flexibility. The Intel 8086, launched in 1978, introduced the foundational x86 architecture, which would dominate computing for decades. Later, the Intel 80286 brought memory management enhancements, enabling the transition to more complex software environments. Notable processors included: Intel 8086 – The original x86, known for powering the IBM PC in the early 1980s. Intel 80286 – First used in IBM PC/AT computers, offering improved memory management. Motorola 68000 – Widely used in Apple’s original Macintosh and early gaming consoles.

As I was preparing for the and conference in Berlin on 11 December, my daughter who is studying economics in Rotterdam walked in - and showed me her textbook with now quite old framework* - the BCG Matrix used to decide on portfolio of businesses to divest and invest in. She asked me - is this relevant in your work still dad?  This made me step back, smile and start reflecting on how traditional frameworks like the for prioritising investments might evolve for the renewable fuels world. What if we rethought the axes?  Instead of market share and market growth, imagine the BCG Matrix used to prioritise investments or divestments mapped to:  Policy Alignment (X-axis): How aligned is a company's strategy with regulatory direction?  Agility (Y-axis): How quickly can a company adapt to shifting energy policies and market needs?  With these new axes, who would be the of renewable fuels? Likely, it’s firms leading in both agility and alignment—think digital-first hydrogen pioneers, flexible biofuel / efuel innovators, and CCUS-driven decarbonization platforms. These companies have both the policy focus and ability to pivot as targets evolve.  Cash ? Established LNG exporters or oil majors investing heavily in biofuels amd Hydrogen derivatives —well aligned but slower to adapt.  ? Early-stage hydrogen startups or e-fuel developers—innovative but navigating regulatory ambiguity.  to divest? Technologies with high inertia and weak alignment, such as rigid fossil-dependent processes firms that refuse to back energy transition.  For investors and policymakers, this reframed matrix underscores importance of two challenges when thinking on investment landscape improvement for moving gasworld to netzero:  1) How do we foster policy clarity to guide policy alignment for energy industry?  2) How can industry enhance agility in navigating rapid transitions to follow and anticipate policy?  Looking forward to exploring this idea and debating in our panel with energy leaders in Berlin on 11 December including,, and.  What’s your take? Are ability to deal with agility and policy alignment the right metrics for picking the firms best positioned for the renewable fuels transition? Let me know, or let’s grab a coffee in Berlin.

A safe home A tissue-hander A safety net A cheerleader A chef A captain A comedian A lover A fighter (in all the good ways) A best friend  This man has offered me his life and made me part of his.  Over the years, I have battled job changes, insecurities, loneliness, hyper anxiety, excruciatingly high self-expectations, self-esteem issues, amd so much more. This man has stood beside me, picked me up, and asked how he can support me, every. single. time.  What advise would I share? Take the time to find the people who make your soul sparkle 💖  I pray, whether it's a friend or family, that you, too, can experience the magic in finding your tribe ✨️  To my husband, Stan, thank you.

2024-11-24,Robert Kargbo,CMC Project Lead at Usona Institute,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a progressive degenerative disease that leads to visual impairment, predominantly affecting the elderly. Despite significant advancements in treatment, a definitive cure remains elusive. Current therapeutic strategies only slow down disease progression, inhibiting abnormal blood vessels growth, and preserving or improving vision. Among these strategies, photodynamic therapy (PDT) has emerged as a promising treatment, particularly for neovascular form, the most severe form of the disease. Although several photosensitizers (PS) have been developed, only one has received clinical approval for use in AMD. This treatment involves the intravenous administration of a photosensitizing agent that preferentially accumulates in the abnormal blood vessels beneath the macula. Upon activation by targeted laser light, the PS triggers photochemical reactions, leading to vascular occlusion and the reduction of choroidal neovascularization. This review provides a comprehensive overview of both experimental and clinical studies on PDT for AMD, discussing the current state of research, challenges in treatment optimization, and potential future directions to enhance this therapeutic approach.-",0.5245,NEGATIVE,0.9697

However, under the UN Charter on Fundamental Rights every state has the ""Responsibility to Protect"" its citizens anywhere in the world. Many UN states cannot fulfil this duty. Russia the world's largest land forces & nuclear power and worlds 2nd largest Air and Naval power can when it's citizens suffering massacres and crimes against humanity by a regime that ended it's legal basis for independence and sovereignty by trying and failing to join NATO breaking its legal requirement to be neutral under international law can do so.

But as a wise German who could learn once pointed out,  ""If we learn anything from history, it is that humans can learn nothing from history""  I think as a German he was speaking about the so-called Herren-Volke. Now NATO forces have invaded Russia and attacked them with short range missiles, I imagine it will take the Russians to do what they and their former USSR compatriots in the Ukrainian SSR did and go all the way to Berlin again, but this time on to the Rhine.  Thank God the EU state of the Republic of Ireland still under partial UK led NATO occupation, like the EU state of the Republic of Cyprus (currently occupied by both UK & Turkey, although Turkey wisely wants to join the Russian led BRICS+), has nothing to do with this revanchist rubbish. all those who advocate war must either serve on the front line or if too old and frail like Furherline VDL they must have their children in the front row!

Hardware performance is critical. Y's Modern CPUs have evolved to help make AI performant for the RAN. The modern CPUs include several features that accelerate AI models. These include Vector Extensions for , support for lower precision calculations for faster AI training and inference, Matrix Extensions etc.  Y's modern CPUs support Layer 1&2 functions as well as efficiently run the AI models to achieve a robust AI-for-RAN realisation.    Y's partner Vendor-X, a founding member of AI-RAN Alliance, has developed embedded for multiple NR signal processing algorithms with a precisely designed deep neural network ( ).  Y and X have collaborated to bring this transformational AI software to market as part of the Y's (Y1) software suite.  X's 5G AI embedded software provides DNN-based physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH) channel estimation routines (for standard MIMO), and SRS channel estimation and pre-coding routines (for ). X's 5G AI software components can be leveraged by existing customers of Y1 suite without additional hardware or software stack changes.  By using for L1 processing, less compute is required to process the uplink (PUSCH) signals in standard MIMO configurations, increasing the number of sectors per server and reducing their cost of operation.  The ML-driven L1 processing improves SINR that enables increased throughput and coverage, optimizing the value and utilization of costly spectrum licenses and band allocations. SINR improvements can also enable bandwidth increases, reduced user traffic latency, and a smaller interference margin for cell planning.    To help developers take advantage of Y's modern CPUs, Y has a strong software support for developer ecosystem.  Y has released optimized libraries, such as Y's Deep Neural Network Library, Math Kernel Library, and AI & Data Analytics Library etc.  Tragedy is Y has not joined the AI-RAN Alliance.  ▪️ Divide & Rule  N is a founding member of AI-RAN Alliance and there is a fierce historic rivalry between N and Y, but still both are deeply committed to unlock AI's potential for / .  Their hw & sw approach differs, but they have a common mighty #1 enemy in Team ClosedRAN.

With the power to perform over 2,700 quadrillion operations per second, El Capitan is not just a technological marvel—it’s a revolution in computational science.  🧠Built-in collaboration withand, this exascale system is designed to solve some of the most complex problems related to nuclear stockpile stewardship, AI training, and large-scale simulation. It will empower researchers to model and simulate nuclear weapons performance, materials science, and climate change with unprecedented speed and detail.  💻But the journey doesn’t stop there. Tuolumne, a smaller but equally powerful system, will expand the scope to unclassified science, supporting global efforts in astrophysics, nuclear structure, and more. Excited about the possibilities this technology unlocks for the future of science and national security.  💡El Capitan, in particular, is expected to significantly enhance the capabilities of the Stockpile Stewardship Program, allowing for a more detailed understanding of nuclear weapon physics, the effects of weapon aging, and the overall integrity of stockpiles. This method not only provides real-time insights but also supports long-term nuclear non-proliferation goals, ensuring that nations can monitor and maintain nuclear arsenals without resorting to destructive testing.  📌 Ethical and Political Dimensions  While nuclear simulations offer a path forward in the absence of physical testing, they also raise important ethical and political questions. The CTBT was designed not only to prevent the development of new nuclear weapons but also to limit the further proliferation of nuclear capabilities. The reliance on simulation, however, could allow countries to continue to enhance their nuclear stockpiles under the radar, potentially undermining the spirit of disarmament efforts.  Additionally, the technological advancements that enable such simulations also bring concerns related to arms races, with countries possibly engaging in a competitive development of more advanced weapons under the guise of maintaining or improving existing arsenals.

But soon after we complete task ,they will say they gonna send the payment but at the last moment they will say our ID is not registered amd asks for $50 or couple of amount in order to receive payment.  the most skeptical thing is ,where you complete the task worth $20-$30 but the company will say that they will send around $1500 t0 $2000 and ask for a non refundable registration or of $50 which tottaly doesn't make sense.  a lot of people has fallen in this trap ,amd the worst part is we won't be able to to cyber complaint since it's a small amount but as per the engagement on post,we can clearly see that there are large number of victims who got scammed.  so here we wasted our time by completing the task and not even get paid.i would like to request to all of you for a help to stop this scam. atleast we can help people who got scammed and return their money.the numbers of scammed person are increasing day by day .

From there, I can home in on the stocks on the cutting edge of those megatrends.I did this in 2015, when many were panicking about plunging oil prices and a global economic slowdown. That same year, I recommended investors buy the dip in an up-and-coming chipmaker called Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). A few years later, AMD stock had soared more than 8,000%. I was also able to do this in 2018, when the market was crashing due to the Fed’s aggressive rate hikes. In the midst of that crash, I recommended investors buy the dip in tech stocks like The Trade Desk (TTD), Roku (ROKU), and Tesla (TSLA). All three went on to soar around 1,000% over the next two years Let me start my discussion of quantum computing by saying that the underlying physics of this technological breakthrough – quantum mechanics – is a highly complex topic. It would likely require over 500 pages to fully understand.For centuries, scientists have developed, tested, and validated the laws of the physical world, known as classical mechanics. These scientifically explain how and why things work, where they come from, so on and so forth.But in 1897, J.J. Thomson discovered the electron. And he unveiled a new, subatomic world of super-small things that didn’t obey the laws of classical mechanics… at all. Instead, they obeyed their own set of rules, which have since become known as quantum mechanics.The rules of quantum mechanics differ from that of classical mechanics in two very weird, almost-magical ways.

2024-11-24,Aditya Raj,Cloud | Linux | Kubernetes | Docker | Security & Networking | C++ Enthusiast,"What Are Meltdown and Spectre Vulnerabilities? In 2018, two major vulnerabilities shook the tech world: Meltdown and Spectre. These flaws were found in modern processors (like Intel, AMD, and ARM) and impacted almost all devices—computers, servers, and smartphones. What Went Wrong? Modern processors use a feature called speculative execution to boost speed by predicting tasks. Hackers found a way to exploit this and access sensitive data like passwords and encryption keys. Meltdown: Hackers could directly access the CPU’s restricted memory, which should be private to the system. Think of it as someone unlocking a staff-only room and stealing confidential files. Spectre: Hackers could trick applications into revealing their private data. It’s like peeking into someone else’s notebook without them knowing. Why Does This Matter? Widespread Impact: Almost all devices with modern processors were affected. Sensitive Data Leaks: Passwords, encryption keys, and personal data were at risk. Stealthy: These vulnerabilities were hard to detect. What Was Done to Fix It? Software Updates were released to patch these flaws. New Processor Designs now make speculative execution more secure. The Lesson: Even the most advanced systems can have flaws. Regular updates and better security practices are crucial for protecting our devices.",0.5208,NEGATIVE,0.9993

2024-11-24,Frederic Hamon,Chirurgien ophtalmologiste specialisé en Retine,"Question is still, alas , if a cheap treatment could interest a lot of people, comparing to the lot of money expected with new expansive treatments ? Perhaps mainly the patients ? “For patients battling the relentless advance of geographic atrophy (GA), a severe form of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), 2023 marked a game-changing moment as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) greenlit not one, but two revolutionary treatments: pegcetacoplan injection (SYFOVRE) and avacincaptad pegol (IZERVAY).  => However, despite these agents achieving the first FDA approvals, they may not have marked the completion of the GA treatment journey. Although designed to halt the progression of GA, both pegcetacoplan and avacincaptad pegol fall short of preventing the disease or improving a patient’s visual acuity +++ (…) Beyond its primary use as an anti-diabetic medication, metformin has been linked to anti-aging and neuroprotective properties. (…) As AMD is a disease of the retina, and if indeed, metformin has anti-aging properties, it can also affect macular degeneration,” Dimitra Skondra , MD, PhD, an associate professor of ophthalmology and visual science at University of Chicago , told HCPLive. “That will be an attractive candidate because it’s a non-invasive way that can be used for a more preventive intervention before people go to the advanced stages and more targeted interventions are needed.” (…) In the search for alternative agents to treat GA, metformin is an attractive candidate, not just for its well-tested nature in diabetes, but also for an impressive clinical data set for AMD. Multiple observational studies have reported a protective effect of metformin against the likelihood of AMD development, including dry AMD. (…) => in Skondra’s view, metformin could already slot into the treatment armamentarium as an early-stage treatment, working to delay the progression to GA in a non-invasive matter.Given this promising evidence base, Skondra urged the need for a prospective clinical trial before wider implementation of metformin for GA.  “[Metformin’s] almost the perfect candidate for a non-invasive strategy to target patients when they’re earlier in the disease stage,” Skondra said. “It’s safe, affordable, and may help delay the process until they go to advanced stages of wet AMD or GA in particular.”",0.5276,NEGATIVE,0.9964

11/22/2024,Roger Behr,Interim Manager / General & Lean Supply Chain Management,"Nvidia: the most valuable company in the world! (Nov 21, 2024) The release of Q3 FY25 quarterly figures shows that Nvidia is continuing its formidable growth trend. Nvidia shares have risen up almost 200% in 2024 and up to 1000% in the last 2 years, making Nvidia the most valuable company in the world with a market cap of $3.6 trillion (Apple $3.45 trillion). Nvidia even reached a new all-time high today.  Although the company has struggled to keep up with demand and faced production difficulties this year, no other chipmaker managed to take market share from Nvidia. Its revenue is on track to double for the second year in a row, generating more money in gross profit than it used to generate in revenue, thanks to a 75% gross profit margin.  Nvidia's data center division now generates more revenue than its two closest competitors, Intel and AMD, combined.  Nvidia's flagship product is its AI (accelerator) chip, which facilitates the development of artificial intelligence models by processing massive amounts of data. Since OpenAI’s ChatGPT launch in 2022, a rush for AI services has generated insatiable demand for such chips.  Major Nvidia customers such as Microsoft, Amazon’s AWS and Meta have reiterated their willingness to invest in AI infrastructure, although few have actually made that spending so far.  The company hopes to stay ahead of its rivals by accelerating the pace of innovation. This requires a commitment to update the product line annually. Nvidia is currently introducing Blackwell, a graphics processing unit (GPU) microarchitecture, which is faster and offers improved ability to interface with other chips. This innovation is expected to impact results early next year, although production challenges have delayed its launch. For now, Nvidia can’t keep up with all incoming orders, according to CEO, Jensen Huang. He is confident that once production improves, supplies will be plentiful, assuming that no faster and cheaper chips have been brought to market by competitors in the meantime.  However, investor enthusiasm for artificial intelligence may be outpacing reality. There seems to be a rotation in the stock markets from mega-caps to mid-caps. And by the way, Bitcoin is aiming for $100,000 with a market cap of almost $2 trillion.",0.5739,POSITIVE,0.7433

H200 in regular PCIe card format is extremely useful in itself given the 141GB of HBM memory onboard. In addition, the bridging kit means users can connect up to 4 x H200 PCIe GPU's together over NVLink (and PCIe).  The cards can be deployed in a wide variety of industry-standard//-based server platforms for which suitable systems have been on the market for several years.  Given the 141GB of HBM memory onboard in each GPU, that's 564GB across the four cards.  Performance is slightly down vs the 8 way SXM based H200 equivalent due to the PCIe card being limited to 600W but we see a wide variety of use cases for which this architecture will fit.

However, Wall Street's focus shifted to Nvidia's Q4 forecast, which, while exceeding average analyst expectations of $37.1 billion with a projection of $37.5 billion, fell short of the loftiest estimates of $41 billion. This tempered some of the AI-fueled enthusiasm around the company. Despite production delays for its new Blackwell chips and supply constraints, Nvidia's growth remains remarkable, driven by insatiable demand for its AI accelerator chips from industry giants like Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta. CEO Jensen Huang underscored the company's commitment to annual innovation and the transformative potential of AI across industries. Although manufacturing hurdles are slowing progress, Nvidia's dominance in AI hardware remains unshaken, even as cautious investors pushed shares down 4%.  My Take  Nvidia’s tempered outlook for Q4 reflects the natural ebb in hype cycles but underscores the company’s operational bottlenecks more than market saturation. Its commitment to annual innovation, demonstrated by Blackwell, is an ambitious strategy to maintain dominance, though it risks stretching supply chains thin. As AI adoption spreads across industries and nations, Nvidia’s challenge will be balancing demand with production scalability to avoid missed opportunities. With competitors like AMD and Intel ramping up their efforts, Nvidia’s leadership in AI hardware is secure for now—but only if it can execute flawlessly on its promises.

When this happened in 2015 and 2016, it sparked big outflows that cost China $1trn in official foreign exchange reserves…The main lesson from that episode is to allow a front-loaded, large fall in the renminbi, so that households cannot front-run depreciation,” he said. For emerging markets, such a large depreciation will be seismic. Markets will interpret a tariff war and all the instability that goes with it as a negative for global growth. Secondly, global trade is dollar-denominated, which means emerging markets lose purchasing power when the dollar rises. Financial conditions will – in effect – tighten, which will also weigh on commodities.  👉 Wall Street’s largest financial institutions have loaned more than $11 billion to a niche group of ‘neocloud’ tech companies, including CoreWeave, Crusoe and Lambda Labs, based on their possession of the world’s hottest commodity -’s artificial intelligence chips known as GPUs, raising concerns this could be creating a fast-growing leveraged debt bubble, the FT writes. These companies are pivotal in building AI infrastructure and they have expanded rapidly with CoreWeave’s valuation soaring to $19bn from $2bn in the past 18 months. Loans are driven by high-demand contracts, such as CoreWeave’s billion-dollar agreement with Microsoft, and are secured against Nvidia’s GPUs. “The lenders all coming in push the story that you can borrow against these chips and add to the frenzy that you need to get in now,” Nate Koppikar, a short seller at hedge fund Orso Partners, was quoted by the FT as saying. ”But chips are a depreciating, not appreciating, asset.” Critics warn that falling GPU prices and increased competition fromand proprietary AI chips threaten Nvidia’s supply chokehold, while expiring leasing contracts could lead to a market oversupply.",0.5296,NEGATIVE,0.9751

11/17/2024,Uwagood Uwagood,--,"How Much Faster Is The Ps5 Pro Compared To The Ps5?  The PlayStation 5 Pro is widely anticipated as an enhanced version of Sony’s current PS5 console, expected to deliver higher performance and faster processing speeds to improve gaming experiences even further. Sony’s move toward an upgraded PS5 aligns with a broader industry trend of mid-cycle console updates, as seen with the PS4 Pro in the previous generation. With the PS5 already a powerhouse in terms of gaming hardware, many are curious just how much faster the PS5 Pro will be and what these improvements will mean for gameplay, loading times, and graphics performance. This article delves into the potential performance boosts, architectural changes, and technological advancements that could make the PS5 Pro a significantly faster console than the PS5.  1. Expected Hardware Upgrades in the PS5 Pro  The most straightforward path to increased speed is upgrading the hardware inside the console. Here’s an overview of the key areas in which the PS5 Pro might improve over the PS5:  CPU (Central Processing Unit): The PS5 uses a custom AMD Zen 2-based octa-core CPU, clocked at 3.5 GHz. The PS5 Pro is likely to feature a newer AMD CPU, potentially based on the Zen 3 or Zen 4 architecture. Newer architectures not only run at faster clock speeds but also improve processing efficiency, allowing for better overall performance. A faster CPU will allow the PS5 Pro to handle more complex game physics, AI calculations, and background processes, resulting in a smoother experience with fewer bottlenecks.  GPU (Graphics Processing Unit): The PS5’s GPU is a custom RDNA 2-based chip from AMD, with a total power of 10.28 teraflops. The PS5 Pro is expected to have a more powerful GPU, possibly based on AMD’s RDNA 3 or even RDNA 4 architecture. This would increase its teraflop count, allowing the console to handle more detailed graphics, improved lighting effects, and enhanced ray tracing performance. Faster graphics processing means games will look and feel even more immersive, with higher resolutions, better visual effects, and potentially support for 8K gaming.  RAM and Bandwidth: The PS5 has 16 GB of GDDR6 RAM, which has proven adequate but could be a bottleneck as game assets grow larger and more complex. The PS5 Pro could potentially increase memory to 20 GB or higher, allowing for faster data retrieval and reducing load times. Additionally, increasing memory bandwidth could allow the console to process data-intensive tasks, such as 4K textures and ray tracing, more efficiently.  Storage (SSD Upgrades): The PS5’s ultra-fast SSD, with a read speed of around 5.5 GB/s, was a game-changer upon its release. However, technology has continued to advance, and it’s possible that the PS5 Pro could feature a faster SSD, reaching speeds of 7-10 GB/s. This would further reduce load times, allow for smoother transitions between in-game areas, and provide a more seamless experience for large, open-world games.  2....",0.5264,POSITIVE,0.743

11/17/2024,Uwagood Uwagood,--,"Will Ps5 Pro Offer Improved Ray Tracing Support?  The PS5 Pro is the much-anticipated upgrade to Sony’s PlayStation 5, and one of the most exciting features rumored to accompany it is enhanced ray tracing support. Since the launch of the PS5, ray tracing has been a game-changer, making graphics look more realistic by simulating the behavior of light with unprecedented accuracy. Games that support ray tracing can display highly realistic reflections, shadows, and lighting effects, creating a visually immersive experience. But as games become more demanding, there’s always room for improvement in hardware performance, and the PS5 Pro is anticipated to take ray tracing to the next level.  This article explores whether the PS5 Pro will indeed offer improved ray tracing capabilities, how it might achieve this, and what it could mean for gamers. In doing so, we'll look at the advancements in hardware that are anticipated, the role of ray tracing in modern gaming, and how Sony could leverage new technologies to stay competitive in a market where visual fidelity is becoming a major selling point.  What is Ray Tracing?  Ray tracing is a rendering technique that produces incredibly lifelike lighting effects by tracing the path of light as it interacts with objects in a scene. Traditional rendering methods, like rasterization, approximate light to save processing power, which can sometimes produce less realistic results. In contrast, ray tracing calculates how light interacts with surfaces, including how it reflects, refracts, or absorbs on various materials. This approach has been widely adopted in the film industry for CGI, but its application in real-time video games has only become feasible with the recent generation of gaming consoles and GPUs.  While the PS5 supports ray tracing, it comes at a cost in terms of performance, often requiring games to run at lower frame rates or resolutions to accommodate this demanding feature. With the PS5 Pro, however, gamers are hoping for a smoother experience—one where they can enjoy high-quality ray tracing without sacrificing frame rate or resolution.  Expected Hardware Improvements in the PS5 Pro  To enable improved ray tracing, the PS5 Pro would need substantial hardware enhancements over the base PS5 model. Here are a few anticipated upgrades:  Enhanced GPU: The PlayStation 5 is equipped with a custom AMD RDNA 2 GPU, which supports ray tracing at a basic level. However, for significant improvement in ray tracing performance, the PS5 Pro will likely need a more powerful GPU, possibly based on AMD’s RDNA 3 or RDNA 4 architecture. These architectures are designed with better ray tracing support, offering more ray tracing cores and improved parallel processing capabilities. An upgraded GPU would allow the PS5 Pro to render more complex ray tracing effects in real time, potentially at higher resolutions and frame rates.

11/17/2024,Uwagood Uwagood,--,"How Does the PS5 Pro Compare to the Xbox Series X?  The console gaming landscape is heating up as Sony prepares to release the PS5 Pro, an upgraded version of the PS5 designed to push performance, graphics, and features beyond the base model. As the Xbox Series X has been Microsoft’s flagship console since its 2020 release, it already boasts impressive specs and remains a formidable competitor in the gaming world. With the arrival of the PS5 Pro, many gamers are left wondering how it will stack up against the Xbox Series X. Here, we’ll break down the anticipated differences and similarities across various key areas such as performance, graphics, game library, and more to determine how the PS5 Pro might compare to the Xbox Series X.  1. Performance and Processing Power  One of the biggest points of comparison between the PS5 Pro and Xbox Series X will be their performance capabilities. While the PS5 and Xbox Series X are quite powerful, the PS5 Pro is expected to raise the bar even further.  CPU and GPU: The Xbox Series X is powered by a custom AMD Zen 2 CPU with 8 cores at 3.8 GHz, paired with an AMD RDNA 2-based GPU, providing 12 teraflops of graphical processing power. Meanwhile, the PS5 Pro is rumored to feature an upgraded AMD Zen 4 CPU and an RDNA 3-based GPU. This could give the PS5 Pro a considerable edge in processing and graphical power, though exact specs aren’t confirmed. If these rumors hold, the PS5 Pro may surpass the Xbox Series X in raw power, potentially offering smoother frame rates and better support for advanced graphical features like ray tracing.  Frame Rates and Resolution: Xbox Series X supports 4K gaming at up to 120 FPS and even offers the potential for 8K output. The PS5 Pro will also target 4K at high frame rates, with the potential for more stable 4K and higher frame rates in more demanding games, thanks to its upgraded hardware. If the PS5 Pro’s specs match expectations, it may achieve native 4K at 120 FPS in a wider range of games than the Xbox Series X, providing a slightly more consistent high-performance experience.  Load Times: Both consoles already benefit from fast load times due to their SSDs, but the PS5’s custom SSD currently loads games faster than the Xbox Series X in many cases. The PS5 Pro will likely include an even faster SSD, which would further minimize load times. This means that while Xbox Series X is no slouch in terms of load speeds, the PS5 Pro could provide the fastest game loading experience available in the console market.  2. Graphics and Visual Fidelity  Graphics have always been a major selling point for any console, and both the Xbox Series X and the PS5 Pro aim to offer stunning visuals.  Ray Tracing and Visual Effects: Xbox Series X already supports ray tracing, and the PS5 Pro is expected to improve upon the PS5’s current ray tracing capabilities, potentially delivering more realistic lighting and reflections. This could make games look even more immersive on the PS5 Pro,...",0.5182,POSITIVE,0.9702

11/17/2024,Uwagood Uwagood,--,"Is the PS5 Pro Worth Upgrading from the PS5?  The PS5 Pro is here, boasting new features and capabilities over the original PS5. With hardware upgrades, enhanced graphics, and faster processing power, many current PS5 owners are wondering whether it’s worth upgrading to the PS5 Pro. Let’s break down the potential advantages, considering graphics, performance, and other key factors that could impact the value of this upgrade.  1. Performance Boost  One of the PS5 Pro’s main selling points is its upgraded performance capabilities. Equipped with a more powerful CPU and GPU, the PS5 Pro promises faster load times, more stable frame rates, and improved support for 4K gaming. Here’s a closer look at the core performance areas that might interest gamers:  Enhanced Processing Power: With a likely jump to a custom AMD RDNA 3-based GPU and a faster Zen 4 CPU, the PS5 Pro is designed for users who want more power for demanding games. If you’re used to the PS5’s 30-60 FPS gameplay in certain titles, the PS5 Pro’s capability for stable 60-120 FPS gameplay could be compelling. The frame rate boost could mean smoother and more responsive gameplay, especially for fast-paced or graphically intensive titles.  Ray Tracing Improvements: The PS5 Pro's hardware can handle more complex ray tracing, which should lead to better light, shadow, and reflection effects in games that support it. Ray tracing is already impressive on the PS5, but the Pro aims to deliver it at a higher resolution and with fewer performance trade-offs. For players who value graphical fidelity, this could make the upgrade worthwhile.  2. Visual Fidelity and 4K Gaming  For gamers with a 4K TV, the PS5 Pro’s enhanced support for 4K resolution could be a significant selling point. The Pro is designed to offer a native 4K experience in more games, reducing the reliance on upscaling. Key visual benefits include:  Higher-Resolution Textures: The PS5 Pro’s added power allows developers to use higher-resolution textures in games. This means greater detail in environments, characters, and effects, which can enhance immersion.  More Stable 4K Gaming: While the PS5 can support 4K, it often has to downscale or use dynamic resolution scaling in intensive games to maintain frame rates. The PS5 Pro can better handle native 4K at a consistent 60 FPS or higher, which could lead to a visibly sharper and smoother experience.  8K Potential: Sony has teased potential 8K support for the PS5 Pro, which, while not a mainstream gaming resolution yet, may appeal to future-proofing enthusiasts. However, the practicality of 8K for most gamers is still limited, as 8K monitors and TVs are rare and costly.  3. VR and Expanded Peripheral Support  The PS5 Pro is expected to be optimized for VR gaming, particularly with the PlayStation VR2 headset in mind. Key upgrades here include:  Better VR Experiences: The improved hardware in the PS5 Pro should help reduce motion sickness, lag, and other VR performance issues by ensuring...",0.5175,POSITIVE,0.8007

To be honest, sometimes I really don’t. With the computer power that is needed recently to open up a game, it’s up to chances whether I can play any games. That is why the recent announcement of AI upscaling on PS5 Pro, called PSSR.  This is not actually new as others have already introduced this kind of upscaling, like FSR by AMD, DLSS by NVIDIA, with both striving to run games at a lower resolution and upscaling them.  While DLSS uses AI and specialized hardware for detailed upscaling, FSR mainly tries to upscale games without any hardware to support so the results may be worse.  PSSR, or PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution, is Sony’s answer to NVIDIA and AMD. Supposedly it also takes advantage of machine learning hardware to upscale the games and has been trained on various games owned by Sony. So far, the results have been quite good as it may not be able to compete with Nvidia’s DLSS, it is handily beating FSR. I’m quietly optimistic about this tech as its implementation might be limited.  Here’s hoping for a future 8k-capable gaming console from Sony.",0.5296,NEGATIVE,0.9928

AMD was on a survival mode for some time now, fighting Intel on one side and Nvidia on the other. While the rivals went to the bank laughing all the way, AMD was nursing it's wounds.  AMD has major deals with server OEMs and cloud service providers such as Dell Technologies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Supermicro and Microsoft Azure, helping the company to aim for $4 billion in data center GPU revenue for the entire year 2024.  However this is a fraction of the $19.4 billion Nvidia made from data center compute products in Q1'24 alone.  ✅Has “no choice” but to “dramatically” increase its investments in AI and release accelerator chips at a faster cadence, Will release a new data center GPU every year instead of every two years. ✅ Will offer significantly greater high-bandwidth memory than Nvidia’s H200 with its 288-GB Instinct MI325X. AMD believes that Nvidia very deliberately stepped on the accelerator to crowd out competition.  Crucially, the MI325X will feature an HBM3e high-bandwidth memory capacity of 288 GB, which is an area that has become critical in generative AI computing due to the increasingly gigantic models that are used to enable cutting-edge capabilities.  ✅Embrace open software and open standards, which will prevent customers from getting locked into working with one vendor.  Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang loves locking-in his customers. He famously declared in his Computex keynote earlier this month. “Our basic philosophy is very simple: build the entire data center scale, disaggregate it and sell it to you in parts on a one-year rhythm, and we push everything to the technology limits,”  While AMD traditionally championed open source drivers for Linux, its current efforts are viewed as ""not serious"" by the developer community as compared to Nvidia's quasi standard which quickly dominated the bourses. ✅AMD also believes that it has scored a point over it's rival because customers are exploring alternatives due to pricing and availability reasons. However Nvidia’s current-generation GPUs like the H100 are becoming easier to obtain after several months of shortages. ✅But customers continue to prefer Nvidia because of its pervasive software stack.

On top of that, AMD has historically taken the lead in multi-threaded performance  ❌ Myth 2: AMD laptops are only suitable for budget-conscious buyers. ✅ Fact: AMD offers a range of processors that cater to both budget and high-end markets. Their Ryzen Pro series, for example, is designed specifically for business use, offering features like enhanced security and manageability  ❌ Myth 3: Intel CPUs are more reliable. ✅ Fact: Both AMD and Intel produce reliable CPUs.

10/6/2024,Matthias Hohensee,"Bureau Chief Silicon Valley at Wirtschaftswoche, Moderator, Speaker","Stories of world-famous companies almost being swallowed up by a larger competitor and thus almost never becoming famous are part of Silicon Valley folklore.   The most famous example is, which was almost sold to its competitor Excite for 750,000 dollars in 1999. Or, which wanted to take overfor almost one billion dollars. And of course there is also an anecdote about, currently one of the most highly valued companies in the world thanks to its AI chips. In 2006, chip manufacturerwanted to enter the graphics card industry and considered acquiring Nvidia. The deal fell through because Nvidia boss Jensen Huang and the then AMD CEO Hector Ruiz were unable to reach an agreement. AMD bought ATI instead.  Google, Meta and Nvidia are now among the most influential companies in the tech industry. Excite, on the other hand, no longer exists. Yahoo - now a mere shadow of its former self - is owned by the investment company Apollo Management. But AMD, which almost went bankrupt due to the high debt burden from the ATI purchase, has really blossomed under its current boss Lisa Su.  What's more, AMD, which, like Nvidia, has its headquarters in Santa Clara in Silicon Valley, has become Nvidia's most important competitor. AMD is the number 2 in the market for AI accelerators, ahead ofwith its Gaudi series and Google with Tensor, that is mainly used internally. The gap to Nvidia is, of course, huge. Nvidia's sales of AI accelerators are estimated at 105 billion dollars this year, while AMD will probably reach five billion dollars.  Now AMD boss Lisa Su is making a big purchase. The expertise to expand the market position is to come from, or more precisely from its engineers.

10/6/2024,William W Collins,"Innovative Transformational Leader | Multi-Industry Experience | AI & SaaS Expert | Generative AI | DevOps, AIOps, SRE & Cloud Technologies | Experienced Writer | Essayist | Digital Content Creator | Author","AMD Stock: Buy, Sell, or Hold?  by newsfeedback@fool.com (Dani Cook) via The Motley Fool ([Global] oracle cloud)  URL:  Chip stocks have captivated Wall Street since the start of last year. An explosion of growth in the artificial intelligence (AI) market highlighted the crucial role chipmakers have to play in the industry's development. As a result, companies like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) rallied and made for attractive ways to invest in the budding AI industry.  Yet AMD's stock is arguably the more compelling buy between the two. The company's market cap is currently $255 billion, compared to Nvidia's, which reached over $3 trillion this year. The considerable difference suggests AMD could have far more room to run than Nvidia in the coming years.  These companies are active in the same high-growth industries. Meanwhile, AMD is investing heavily into AI to catch up to its rival and is already seeing promising results, according to this latest earnings release.  So, here's why now is an excellent time to buy AMD stock before it's too late.  AMD's rivalry with Nvidia is heating up after a recent acquisition  Nvidia's business surged last year as its AI graphics processing units (GPUs) became the go-to for many developers worldwide. The chipmaker's success shed light on how far AMD fell behind in the industry, unable to immediately begin supplying its chips to AI-minded companies. However, AMD hastily worked to catch up, unveiling a line of AI GPUs that attracted prominent cloud companies like Microsoft's Azure, Meta Platforms, and Oracle.  Meanwhile, a Reuters report from Aug. 19 revealed AMD is bolstering its competitive edge by acquiring server maker ZT Systems for $5 billion. The move will expand AMD's access to powerful AI chips and hardware, strengthening its position against Nvidia. Training AI models requires intensive workloads, combining thousands of chips to power massive server systems. ZT Systems should help AMD do this more efficiently, allowing it to release its latest AI GPUs more quickly at a scale necessary for cloud platforms like Azure.  ""The main way (ZT Systems) is additive to the company is we sell more GPUs,"" AMD CEO Lisa Su said. AMD expects the purchase to positively affect its earnings as early as the end of 2025.  A new acquisition that will expand AMD's AI chip output strengthens the bullish argument for its stock. One of the biggest differences between AMD and Nvidia is the scale of their businesses, suggesting this is a step in the right direction.  A diversified business model that exposes investors to multiple areas of tech  Data from Grand View Research shows the AI market hit nearly $200 billion last year and is on track to reach just under $2 trillion by 2030. As a result, it's no surprise that AMD dove head-first into the industry. However, the company has a long history of growth before its recent AI expansion, providing growth catalysts through...",0.5958,NEGATIVE,0.8538

The two main types are:  1. Dry AMD: The more prevalent form, characterized by gradual thinning of the macula and the formation of drusen, small yellow deposits that accumulate under the retina.  2. Wet AMD: This form is less common but more severe, involving the development of abnormal blood vessels that can leak fluid and blood, causing rapid vision loss.  Symptoms of AMD may include:  ✳️Blurred or distorted central vision ✳️Difficulty seeing in low light or at night ✳️Straight lines appearing wavy or distorted ✳️Dark spots or a blank area in the central vision  Risk factors for AMD include:  🟢Age (most common in those over 50) 🟢 Family history of the disease 🟢Smoking 🟢Obesity 🟢High blood pressure 🟢Poor dietary habits 🟢Prolonged exposure to sunlight  While there is currently no for AMD, several treatments can help manage the condition, particularly for wet AMD:  1. Anti-VEGF injections: • Ranibizumab (Lucentis): Developed by Genentech (part of Roche), this medication inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to reduce the growth of abnormal blood vessels. • Aflibercept (Eylea): Manufactured by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, it works similarly by blocking VEGF and preventing fluid leakage. •Brolucizumab (Beovu): Another option from Novartis, it has a similar mechanism but is designed for less frequent dosing.  2. Photodynamic therapy: This treatment involves a light-sensitive drug (verteporfin) followed by laser treatment to target and destroy leaking blood vessels.  3. Nutritional : The AREDS formulation (vitamins C and E, zinc, copper, and lutein) may slow progression in individuals with intermediate to advanced dry AMD.  Regarding drug manufacturers:  🟨Roche is known for developing Lucentis and continues to focus on innovative therapies for retinal diseases. 🟨Novartis manufactures Eylea and is involved in various research initiatives for eye health. 🟨 Regeneron Pharmaceuticals has a portfolio that includes Eylea and is actively researching further treatments for AMD. 🟨Bayer HealthCare collaborates with Regeneron in the development and distribution of Eylea, focusing on advancing eye care treatments. 🟨Kanghong Pharma is a newer player working on treatments for retinal diseases, including those targeting AMD.

We are alive and well""   Intel's Pat Gelsinger also said, ""We see that the x86 architecture, this foundation of computing for decades, is about to go through a period of customization, expansion, scalability (with) the opportunities that AI will present, and our ecosystem is robust and growing."" -  ▪️x86 Ecosystem Advisory Group  Intel invented the x86 computing architecture and AMD licenses the technology from Intel to make chips using x86, competing directly against Intel. AMD use the same underlying x86 technology in their chips, but software sometimes must be tweaked to work across their offerings. Intel and AMD now intend to change that with a new ""Advisory Group.""  Read -  The group will seek technical input for ""essential functions and features"" for chips from Intel and AMD with a goal to enhance customer choice and simplify architectural guidelines for enhanced software consistency and interfaces on x86 product offerings from Intel and AMD.  ▪️The Angle  To provide choices to Telcos the vendor needs to sure it's vDU software/solution is truly multiplatform.  This is an ongoing challenge for the industry struggling to build and deploy portable RAN software running across multiple accelerated computing platforms.  When a vendor says its CloudRAN can go on any hardware or cloud, there are always caveats.  For example, a vendor N's CloudRAN may have as an integral part a ""Smart"" PCIe card powered by it's custom SoC that runs vendor's proprietary L1 acceleration algorithms which are not portable to other computing architectures. The vendor in this case will highlight it's portability across Intel/AMD/AWS/NVIDIA etc. but that is only for the L2+ portion of it's CloudRAN.  Another vendor E's CloudRAN doesn't depend on a ""Smart"" PCIe card with custom SoC. It's L1 acceleration software however still depends on the Intel x86 Xeons CPUs and the vendor has tweaked it to work on AMD's chips as well. However, there is no word yet on support for any ARM-based option.  After Q3 results, the shares of E have hit a two-year high after it saw sales in North America growing 55% y-o-y, most likely due to modernization deal as there is nothing that suggests Verizon or T-Mobile have boosted spending.  ▪️ Rumours of Vendor N's death are severely exaggerated too, just like Intel's  A vendor S was rumoured as a potential buyer of N's RAN business, but it turned out to be fake. S is going through it's own rough patch with layoffs and everything. It's vRAN contract with Verizon runs till 2025e.  A sincere advice to N would be to 'let bygones be bygones' and port vDU L1 on Intel Xeons. This is THE key to making a comeback in US story, especially in VZ first and later in AT&T when it scales CloudRAN in 2027.",0.547,NEGATIVE,0.9996

Động thái này, có khả năng hạn chế năng lực AI của một số quốc gia, sẽ đặt ra hạn mức cho giấy phép xuất khẩu đối với một số quốc gia nhất định vì lợi ích an ninh quốc gia, báo cáo cho biết thêm.  Các quan chức tập trung vào các quốc gia vùng Vịnh Ba Tư, nơi đang cho thấy nhu cầu ngày càng tăng đối với các trung tâm dữ liệu AI và có nhiều quỹ để hỗ trợ những nỗ lực này, báo cáo lưu ý.  Các cuộc thảo luận đang ở giai đoạn đầu và vẫn đang diễn ra, và ý tưởng này đã thu hút được sự chú ý trong những tuần gần đây. Theo báo cáo, sáng kiến này sẽ xây dựng trên một khuôn khổ mới để nới lỏng các yêu cầu cấp phép cho các lô hàng chip AI đến các trung tâm dữ liệu ở các khu vực như Các Tiểu vương quốc Ả Rập Thống nhất và Ả Rập Xê Út.  Tháng trước, các quan chức Bộ Thương mại đã tiết lộ các quy định này và cho biết sẽ có thêm nhiều quy định nữa, báo cáo cho biết thêm.  Người phát ngôn của Hội đồng An ninh Quốc gia Nhà Trắng từ chối cung cấp bất kỳ bình luận nào cho hãng thông tấn này nhưng đã chỉ ra một tuyên bố chung của Hoa Kỳ và UAE về AI.  ""Hoa Kỳ và UAE mong muốn tăng cường hợp tác trong lĩnh vực AI và các công nghệ liên quan để thúc đẩy quan hệ đối tác chiến lược của họ tiến lên phía trước"", thông cáo báo chí ngày 23 tháng 9 cho biết.  Vào năm 2022, Hoa Kỳ đã áp dụng các hạn chế đối với việc xuất khẩu chip tiên tiến và thiết bị liên quan sang Trung Quốc từ các công ty như Nvidia (NVDA). Các hạn chế kể từ đó đã tiếp tục gia tăng đối với các công ty Mỹ và các công ty toàn cầu khác, chẳng hạn như Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Intel (INTC) và ASML (ASML), cùng nhiều công ty khác. Hoa Kỳ và các đồng minh bao gồm Hà Lan, Đức, Hàn Quốc và Nhật Bản đều đã thắt chặt các hạn chế đối với quyền tiếp cận công nghệ bán dẫn tiên tiến của quốc gia châu Á này.  Hoa Kỳ đã hạn chế các lô hàng chip AI của các nhà sản xuất chip như Nvidia và AMD đến hơn 40 quốc gia trên khắp Trung Đông, Châu Phi và Châu Á do lo ngại rằng sản phẩm của họ có thể bị chuyển hướng sang Trung Quốc, báo cáo lưu ý.  Các quan chức lo ngại về cách công nghệ AI sẽ được các quốc gia sử dụng và cách nó có thể tác động đến các hoạt động tình báo của Hoa Kỳ. ""Những rủi ro không chỉ về mặt nhân quyền mà còn về mặt an ninh và rủi ro phản gián đối với nhân viên của chúng tôi trên toàn thế giới là gì"", Maher Bitar, một quan chức của Hội đồng An ninh Quốc gia cho biết tại một sự kiện vào tháng 6.  Trong khi đó, các công ty Trung Quốc đang nỗ lực phát triển chip AI của riêng họ, mặc dù họ vẫn tụt hậu so với các đối tác của Hoa Kỳ.

Des géants comme Nvidia, AMD ou encore Broadcom ont vu leur cours de Bourse dégringoler, entraînant dans leur sillage les principaux indices américains. Le Dow Jones a perdu 0,75%, le Nasdaq 1,01% et le S&P 500 0,76%. Mais quelles sont les causes profondes de cette dégringolade ? Lire la suite  L’alerte d’ASML, le premier domino  Tout a commencé avec l’avertissement sur résultats d’ASML, le géant néerlandais qui fournit des machines indispensables à la production des puces les plus avancées. Selon des sources proches du dossier, si la demande liée à l’intelligence artificielle reste forte, d’autres segments du marché des semi-conducteurs marquent le pas, notamment en Chine. Cette annonce a eu l’effet d’une bombe, faisant craindre un ralentissement plus global du secteur.  La demande n’est pas aussi soutenue que prévu dans certains segments du marché des semi-conducteurs.  – Un porte-parole d’ASML  Nvidia et AMD touchés de plein fouet  Les mastodontes américains Nvidia et AMD ont immédiatement accusé le coup en Bourse, avec des chutes respectives de 4,69% et 5,22%. Il faut dire que ces entreprises sont en première ligne sur le marché des puces pour l’IA et le cloud computing, des secteurs en plein boom mais qui pourraient pâtir d’un ralentissement plus global. Des inquiétudes renforcées par des rumeurs selon lesquelles le gouvernement américain pourrait restreindre les exportations de certaines puces vers le Moyen-Orient, de peur qu’elles ne finissent en Chine.  Un effet domino sur tout le secteur tech  De Broadcom (-3,47%) à Texas Instruments (-4,22%) en passant par Micron (-3,71%), c’est tout le secteur des semi-conducteurs qui a été entraîné dans la spirale baissière. Et par ricochet, l’ensemble du compartiment technologique, très dépendant des puces électroniques, a souffert. Il faut dire que depuis deux ans, les valeurs tech surfent sur la vague de la digitalisation accélérée par le Covid, dont l’IA et le cloud sont des moteurs essentiels. Un ralentissement de la croissance dans les semi-conducteurs pourrait remettre en cause ce scénario.  Des résultats solides passés au second plan  Paradoxalement, les bons résultats publiés par de nombreuses entreprises sont passés au second plan. Goldman Sachs, Bank of America ou encore Johnson & Johnson ont toutes dépassé les attentes, mais cela n’a pas suffi à enrayer la dynamique négative impulsée par les semi-conducteurs. Preuve que les craintes sur la croissance future pèsent plus lourd, aux yeux des investisseurs, que les performances passées.  Le marché a été distrait par la saga des semi-conducteurs, éclipsant de bons résultats par ailleurs.  – Quincy Krosby, stratégiste chez LPL Financial  Une consolidation salutaire ?

You should change your approach and create a strong contender in the top of benchmark charts like you do with CPUs. People get excited when they read about new top NVidia GPUs like 4090 or 5090. The brand 'NVidia' gets engraved in their brains and therefore they give AMD GPUs less attention.  Please create a 5090 killer just for the sake of promotion. It doesn't matter if it will sell poorly. Just show how strong you are so people will consider your mid/low-end GPUs more often. You are already good to go with software - frame generation, upscaling, raytracing etc.  If you don't want to create any new chip being closer to 5090, then at least please create dual chip cards. You could also bring back Crossfire so with two or three 7900 XTX we could have a nice alternative to 4090/5090.  The following hardware survey looks bleak. We need competition.

A note on how Intel missed the AI opportunity and didn't cope with change. Similar story brewing for Apple?  The creator of Silicon Valley, Intel recently lost a $30 Billion deal to provide chips to Sony Playstation to AMD.  This loss also puts a dent in CEO Pat Gelsinger’s turnaround plan for the company. They wanted to create a foundry unit. They had officially entered into contract manufacturing in February 2024.  This deal fell through due to negotiations on profit margins. Months of negotiations, among C-level executives, and engineers all fell through.  This is not the end! The company recently planned to cut 7% of its workforce. They reported over $7 billion in operating losses in their manufacturing business.  Imagine this for a company started by the great Gordon Moore, who is known for Moore’s Law which states that “computer chips would get faster and cheaper every 18 months.”  Nvidia, which was once a shadow of Intel has now outperformed it. So is the case with AMD. Both Nvidia and AMD have outperformed Intel by a huge margin on many fronts.  In 1998 Intel launched Xeon chips for servers, it was for servers that require more computing power. Its campaign of Intel Inside is to date one of the most successful marketing campaigns. Xeon even today has a 75% market share.  History often repeats itself in different ways. You don’t run businesses on cruise mode. You often have to look for new opportunities to expand. Intel didn’t.  Intel failed to see the rise of smartphones. It doesn't operate in the mobile phone chips market where Samsung, Qualcomm, and Mediatek operate. They couldn’t see the profits that they saw in PCs and servers.  Other than this, they failed to see the rise of Machine Learning and AI. Nvidia is now the hero over there with over 90% market share and is also one of the most valuable companies in the world.  The other thing where they failed was on the manufacturing front. It came very late into the manufacturing of chips. It’s only now that it is expanding and building factories for manufacturing.  Basically, Intel was a design company until now. Now, similar is the story for Apple yet not so haunting since it has over $100 billion of Free Cash Flows from its iPhone and has been on cruise mode for years.  It is still riding on Steve Jobs’ inventions. Yep, even the smartwatch. Apple has been slowly developing its services business but doesn't have an AI application of its own, unlike Microsoft or Google. Apple doesn’t have cloud services either.  Therefore, Apple mostly relies on the free cash flow of iPhones. Smartwatches or their services business aren’t that big a thing yet.  The technology sector is known for its almost seismic shift that can upend even the mightiest.  Source: ET",0.5555,NEGATIVE,1.0
10/13/2024,yieldWerx Semiconductor,"6,999 followers","Inside the Semiconductor Supply Chain: The Hidden Heroes Powering Our Digital World 💡  The semiconductor supply chain is a dynamic ecosystem involving a diverse set of specialized players – from the designers of cutting-edge chips to the manufacturers who build and assemble them into the devices we use daily.

Example 2: Amkor Technology specializes in packaging and testing chips, serving top-tier semiconductor companies worldwide.  5) Wafer-Level Packagers Wafer-level packaging (WLP) involves packaging individual dies while they are still on the wafer, enabling higher performance and miniaturization.  Example 1: STATS ChipPAC provides advanced wafer-level packaging technologies to enhance performance and reduce size. Example 2: Deca Technologies specializes in wafer-level fan-out packaging, offering solutions to improve performance for mobile and high-performance computing applications.  6) Electronics Manufacturing Services (EMS) EMS providers assemble the final electronic products that incorporate semiconductor chips into systems.  Example 1: Foxconn is a well-known EMS provider, assembling products like the iPhone for Apple. Example 2: Jabil offers manufacturing services across various industries, including electronics, where semiconductor chips are integrated into larger systems.  7) Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) OEMs produce consumer-ready products, integrating semiconductors into devices that consumers and businesses use every day.

10/12/2024,Martijn Hamann,Co-Owner & Partner @ Endeit Capital | Growth Capital Investor in Future of Work / AI,"“I am AI” That’s a bolt statement but very true for NVIDIA today. We started our 3rd day of the AI Innovation US trip 2024 with a visit at their impressive HQ in Silicon Valley.  The company is led by founder and CEO Jensen Huangwho has driven NVIDIA to a remarkable $70bn revenue run rate today driven by the AI industry’s insatiable demand for their fast GPUs. However, it’s eventually not a race of compute speed (eg AMD vs NVIDIA), but about the machine learning performance. Forecasts expects AI will contribute $4.400 billion (!) impact across global GDP. Walking around and speaking with their VPs make me believe NVIDIA is just warming-up for an even bigger play into an “all-you-can-eat AI” shop to “democratize"" AI globally. What was also interesting to hear is their “National AI program” based on supporting 1. AI R&D Initiatives, 2. Develop AI-Workforce, and 3. Developing an AI eco-system. They have allocated 40% of AI compute capacity to non-developed nations to enable a more Safe, Sustainable and Sovereignty world. NVIDIA’s Mission is to solve big global challenges like climate and healthcare where investments are very high.  The company remains remarkably agile via its “Mission is the Boss” principle to solve those global problems amongst 30k FTEs, who each share monthly their top-5 things where they are working on, creating transparency and collaboration.  NVIDIA showed us their latest super chip at $10k, to be launched in 2025, called the Blackwell GB200, costed $10bn (!!) on R&D. It equals 1.700 laptop compute. The system is 30x faster than the previous architecture. Tesla and Meta have ordered rumored to be 700k chips, enabling their self driving car and metaverse aspirations.  We further spoke about the fast-accelerating transformative impact of AI across various industries today. The world is changing rapidly and jobs need rethinking. What does the “Future of Work” mean? Most will be done by AI. 40% of time is wasted on low value, repetitive tasks and will soon be done by AI. That's positive, but has societal impact and requires re-skilling of large workforces.  Lastly, we spoke about NVIDIAs Corporate Venture arm which invested $1bn in ca 100 companies across AI ML, Robotics, Autonomous Machines and Metaverse Graphics. NVIDIA is also working a lot with startups, called NVIDIA Inception. Currently, the program supports 22.000 startups.  Finally, like in '22, '23 and now '24 we had another fascinating visit with our AI Innovation group of 20+ entrepreneurs where we saw this remarkable company is consistently innovating in technologies and services to solve the biggest problems on our planet. That’s quite a claim and goal, but you can see -aside from all the hardware successes- that NVIDIA is on a bigger and greater mission than I could have imagined a few years back.

While we scroll and create, we only sometimes think about the energy these clever machines need to get the job done!  With AI becoming our new go-to tool for everything from chat to art, the energy bill is starting to add up. Imagine every image being like your phone saying, ""Hey, I need a charge!""  So, what can we do? It's time to come together and advocate for greener AI and smarter tech and maybe… hit 'send' a little less often. 😅🌍  On the serious side, the rapid growth of AI, particularly generative AI, is driving a massive increase in power consumption. Big Tech companies are investing tens of billions quarterly in AI accelerators. This surge transforms power usage into a mission-critical challenge as companies like Nvidia, AMD, and Intel release next-generation AI accelerators that consume significantly more electricity with each iteration. For instance, Nvidia's A100 GPU consumes up to 400W, but its successor, the H100, consumes up to 700W—a 75% increase. Intel's Gaudi 3 accelerator will consume 900W, and its upcoming Falcon Shores hybrid processor is expected to use an astounding 1,500W per chip.  The demand for GPUs is increasing as data centre energy needs are rising rapidly. In 2023, Nvidia alone shipped 3.76 million GPUs, which is estimated to consume 14.38 TWh of power annually, equivalent to the energy usage of over 1.3 million U.S. households. These numbers are expected to increase further with the introduction of Nvidia's Blackwell generation and other AI accelerators. Big Tech's capital expenditures (capex) on AI infrastructure will exceed $200 billion in 2024, primarily for GPUs to power AI training and cloud services.  One of the critical challenges ahead is managing the growing energy consumption while maintaining performance. Although newer GPUs are becoming more power-efficient and delivering more performance per watt, AI systems' sheer scale and power demands are outpacing these efficiency gains.

With my hardware of course being anTUF Gaming A17, AMD Ryzen 7, rocking a 16GB DDR5 and to add the cherry on top anRTX4050 GPU.  So, what's the deal with rendering between Cycles and Eevee? Well, in Blender, Cycles and Eevee are two different rendering engines, and both have their strengths, especially when using an Nvidia RTX 4050.  Cycles: Realism: Cycles is a ray-tracing engine, which means it simulates light more accurately, producing realistic reflections, shadows, and lighting effects.  Performance with RTX 4050: The Nvidia RTX 4050 uses hardware acceleration with CUDA and OptiX, which can significantly speed up Cycles renders, especially when ray tracing is involved.  Best for: Photorealistic renders, high-quality animations, product visualizations, and any scene where accuracy and details are important.  Eevee: Speed: Eevee is a real-time rendering engine, which prioritizes speed over accuracy. It’s not as physically accurate as Cycles but can produce impressive results quickly.  Performance with RTX 4050: Eevee benefits from the RTX 4050’s fast processing power, giving smooth real-time previews and faster final renders.  Best for: Fast animations, scenes where real-time previews are needed, stylized renders, or when the project doesn’t require photorealism.  Use Cycles for high-quality, photorealistic results, taking advantage of the RTX 4050’s ray-tracing power. Use Eevee for faster renders, especially for stylized scenes or when time efficiency is a priority. However, one could also reduce the number of samples when rendering to certainly speed up the process, but that is left entirely up to you as the designer, using your trial and error techniques.",0.5204,POSITIVE,0.9993

The update, through AGESA ComboAM5 PImicrocode, aims to resolve issues affecting gamers, creators, and tech enthusiasts. However, with Intel’s Arrow Lake processors launching soon, AMD may have lost its early competitive advantage. The update addresses two major issues impacting the Ryzen 9000 line-up: overclocking flexibility and inter-core latency. These improvements aim to boost performance while ensuring reliability.  Users can now safely overclock Ryzen 9600X and 9700X chips, pushing power up to 140W without voiding warranties. This gives users greater control, offering more performance without compromising chip lifespan. High-end models like the Ryzen 9900X and 9950X, which use two Complex Compute Dies (CCDs), had performance issues due to inter-core latency. The update reduces the number of transactions needed for core communication, improving multi-core performance in demanding tasks.  The Ryzen 9000 series promised big performance gains but underwhelmed at launch. While these fixes offer better performance and efficiency, especially in multi-core tasks, the upcoming launch of Intel’s Arrow Lake processors adds pressure for AMD to remain competitive. Too Late for AMD to Gain an Edge? AMD originally had a lead with its Ryzen 9000 series, but Intel's Arrow Lake processors could shift the market. With Intel's next-gen CPUs rumoured to offer major improvements, AMD may have missed the chance to solidify its advantage.

As to what parts they used, a full-fat NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 GPU and an AMD Ryzen 7950X3D.  The man took to the Chinese social media platform BiliBili to post his Franken-laptop for all to see, with all the components used in all its glory. To call their machine a “laptop” is a stretch and but in all fairness, this isn’t the first time a person has created such high-powered machines, with the goal of portability somewhat in mind.  (Image source: Bilibili.)  Getting back on, the components they used was a blower-style RTX 4090, the Ryzen 9 7950X3D, an ITX board, 32GB DDR5-6800 RAM, and a speaker system comprising two 20W tweeters plus woofer.  The end result is a system that is seemingly able to maintain its composure. Even in its unorthodox chassis, the RTX 4090 is able to reach and draw the full-fat 450W while staying within the 70°C threshold.  (Image source: Bilibili.)  As for its size, the machine has a thickness of 7cm, so it can still fit inside a backpack. Now here’s the downside: it weighs approximately 7kg, meaning that unless you’re aiming to get swole or you’re doing weight training, you’re better off carrying this machine around using a dolly or a suitcase.

The article discusses achieving FP16 inference with popular LLM models (Llama3-8B and IBM's Granite-8B Code) using 100% OpenAI's Triton Language computation.  2. Triton-based models achieved 0.76-0.78x performance relative to CUDA kernel workflows on Nvidia H100 GPUs, and 0.62-0.82x on Nvidia A100 GPUs.  3. Triton provides a path for enabling LLMs to run on different types of GPUs (NVIDIA, AMD, and potentially Intel) and offers a higher layer of abstraction in Python for GPU programming.  4. The article breaks down the core operations in a Transformer block, including RMSNorm, matrix multiplications, RoPE, attention, and activation functions.  5. To achieve 100% Triton inference, the authors replaced smaller ops with compiler-generated Triton kernels and more complex computations with handwritten Triton kernels.  6. A custom FP16 Triton GEMM kernel using SplitK work decomposition was developed for matrix multiplications in linear layers.  7. The authors evaluated various Triton flash attention kernels and chose the AMD flash attention kernel for its compatibility with torch.compile and ability to produce legible output.  8. End-to-end benchmarks showed that Triton models can achieve up to 78% of the performance of CUDA models on H100 and up to 82% on A100 GPUs.  9. Microbenchmarks revealed that Triton matmul kernels are 1.2-1.4x slower than CUDA, and AMD's Triton Flash Attention kernel is 1.6x slower than CUDA SDPA.  10.

We are alive and well""   Intel's Pat Gelsinger also said, ""We see that the x86 architecture, this foundation of computing for decades, is about to go through a period of customization, expansion, scalability (with) the opportunities that AI will present, and our ecosystem is robust and growing."" -  ▪️x86 Ecosystem Advisory Group  Intel invented the x86 computing architecture and AMD licenses the technology from Intel to make chips using x86, competing directly against Intel. AMD use the same underlying x86 technology in their chips, but software sometimes must be tweaked to work across their offerings. Intel and AMD now intend to change that with a new ""Advisory Group.""  Read -  The group will seek technical input for ""essential functions and features"" for chips from Intel and AMD with a goal to enhance customer choice and simplify architectural guidelines for enhanced software consistency and interfaces on x86 product offerings from Intel and AMD.  ▪️The Angle  To provide choices to Telcos the vendor needs to sure it's vDU software/solution is truly multiplatform.  This is an ongoing challenge for the industry struggling to build and deploy portable RAN software running across multiple accelerated computing platforms.  When a vendor says its CloudRAN can go on any hardware or cloud, there are always caveats.  For example, a vendor N's CloudRAN may have as an integral part a ""Smart"" PCIe card powered by it's custom SoC that runs vendor's proprietary L1 acceleration algorithms which are not portable to other computing architectures. The vendor in this case will highlight it's portability across Intel/AMD/AWS/NVIDIA etc. but that is only for the L2+ portion of it's CloudRAN.  Another vendor E's CloudRAN doesn't depend on a ""Smart"" PCIe card with custom SoC. It's L1 acceleration software however still depends on the Intel x86 Xeons CPUs and the vendor has tweaked it to work on AMD's chips as well. However, there is no word yet on support for any ARM-based option.  After Q3 results, the shares of E have hit a two-year high after it saw sales in North America growing 55% y-o-y, most likely due to modernization deal as there is nothing that suggests Verizon or T-Mobile have boosted spending.  ▪️ Rumours of Vendor N's death are severely exaggerated too, just like Intel's  A vendor S was rumoured as a potential buyer of N's RAN business, but it turned out to be fake. S is going through it's own rough patch with layoffs and everything. It's vRAN contract with Verizon runs till 2025e.  A sincere advice to N would be to 'let bygones be bygones' and port vDU L1 on Intel Xeons. This is THE key to making a comeback in US story, especially in VZ first and later in AT&T when it scales CloudRAN in 2027.",0.547,NEGATIVE,0.9996

This partnership could have several implications for Nvidia and the broader AI landscape: -With Intel and AMD focusing on improving their processors and potentially integrating more advanced AI features, they may become more competitive with Nvidia’s GPUs, which have dominated AI workloads now. The collaboration between Intel and AMD could introduce new dynamics in the industry, fostering competition that could accelerate innovation and lead to more options for developers and customers alike. -A strengthened x86 ecosystem could lead to more robust platforms for AI development. If Intel and AMD enhance their CPUs to better handle AI tasks, it might provide developers with more options beyond Nvidia’s GPUs, leading to a more diverse and competitive marketplace. -If the collaboration results in significant advancements in CPU performance for AI tasks, Nvidia could see pressure on its market share, especially in sectors where CPU-GPU integration becomes crucial for performance. -The group could drive new standards for AI processing on x86 platforms, creating an environment where Intel and AMD can leverage their combined strengths against Nvidia’s dominance in the GPU sector. -As Intel and AMD improve their hardware, there may be a corresponding push for software optimizations that better utilize their architectures.

Động thái này, có khả năng hạn chế năng lực AI của một số quốc gia, sẽ đặt ra hạn mức cho giấy phép xuất khẩu đối với một số quốc gia nhất định vì lợi ích an ninh quốc gia, báo cáo cho biết thêm.  Các quan chức tập trung vào các quốc gia vùng Vịnh Ba Tư, nơi đang cho thấy nhu cầu ngày càng tăng đối với các trung tâm dữ liệu AI và có nhiều quỹ để hỗ trợ những nỗ lực này, báo cáo lưu ý.  Các cuộc thảo luận đang ở giai đoạn đầu và vẫn đang diễn ra, và ý tưởng này đã thu hút được sự chú ý trong những tuần gần đây. Theo báo cáo, sáng kiến này sẽ xây dựng trên một khuôn khổ mới để nới lỏng các yêu cầu cấp phép cho các lô hàng chip AI đến các trung tâm dữ liệu ở các khu vực như Các Tiểu vương quốc Ả Rập Thống nhất và Ả Rập Xê Út.  Tháng trước, các quan chức Bộ Thương mại đã tiết lộ các quy định này và cho biết sẽ có thêm nhiều quy định nữa, báo cáo cho biết thêm.  Người phát ngôn của Hội đồng An ninh Quốc gia Nhà Trắng từ chối cung cấp bất kỳ bình luận nào cho hãng thông tấn này nhưng đã chỉ ra một tuyên bố chung của Hoa Kỳ và UAE về AI.  ""Hoa Kỳ và UAE mong muốn tăng cường hợp tác trong lĩnh vực AI và các công nghệ liên quan để thúc đẩy quan hệ đối tác chiến lược của họ tiến lên phía trước"", thông cáo báo chí ngày 23 tháng 9 cho biết.  Vào năm 2022, Hoa Kỳ đã áp dụng các hạn chế đối với việc xuất khẩu chip tiên tiến và thiết bị liên quan sang Trung Quốc từ các công ty như Nvidia (NVDA). Các hạn chế kể từ đó đã tiếp tục gia tăng đối với các công ty Mỹ và các công ty toàn cầu khác, chẳng hạn như Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Intel (INTC) và ASML (ASML), cùng nhiều công ty khác. Hoa Kỳ và các đồng minh bao gồm Hà Lan, Đức, Hàn Quốc và Nhật Bản đều đã thắt chặt các hạn chế đối với quyền tiếp cận công nghệ bán dẫn tiên tiến của quốc gia châu Á này.  Hoa Kỳ đã hạn chế các lô hàng chip AI của các nhà sản xuất chip như Nvidia và AMD đến hơn 40 quốc gia trên khắp Trung Đông, Châu Phi và Châu Á do lo ngại rằng sản phẩm của họ có thể bị chuyển hướng sang Trung Quốc, báo cáo lưu ý.  Các quan chức lo ngại về cách công nghệ AI sẽ được các quốc gia sử dụng và cách nó có thể tác động đến các hoạt động tình báo của Hoa Kỳ. ""Những rủi ro không chỉ về mặt nhân quyền mà còn về mặt an ninh và rủi ro phản gián đối với nhân viên của chúng tôi trên toàn thế giới là gì"", Maher Bitar, một quan chức của Hội đồng An ninh Quốc gia cho biết tại một sự kiện vào tháng 6.  Trong khi đó, các công ty Trung Quốc đang nỗ lực phát triển chip AI của riêng họ, mặc dù họ vẫn tụt hậu so với các đối tác của Hoa Kỳ. Huawei Technologies là một trong những công ty như vậy, công ty này đã cố gắng cạnh tranh với chip AI của Nvidia tại thị trường Trung Quốc.",0.5095,POSITIVE,0.995

2024-10-16,Maelien Goarin,Actualités & Tendances qui captivent me monde,"Un véritable tremblement de terre a secoué Wall Street ce mardi, avec l’effondrement des valeurs phares du secteur des semi-conducteurs. Des géants comme Nvidia, AMD ou encore Broadcom ont vu leur cours de Bourse dégringoler, entraînant dans leur sillage les principaux indices américains. Le Dow Jones a perdu 0,75%, le Nasdaq 1,01% et le S&P 500 0,76%. Mais quelles sont les causes profondes de cette dégringolade ? Lire la suite  L’alerte d’ASML, le premier domino  Tout a commencé avec l’avertissement sur résultats d’ASML, le géant néerlandais qui fournit des machines indispensables à la production des puces les plus avancées. Selon des sources proches du dossier, si la demande liée à l’intelligence artificielle reste forte, d’autres segments du marché des semi-conducteurs marquent le pas, notamment en Chine. Cette annonce a eu l’effet d’une bombe, faisant craindre un ralentissement plus global du secteur.  La demande n’est pas aussi soutenue que prévu dans certains segments du marché des semi-conducteurs.  – Un porte-parole d’ASML  Nvidia et AMD touchés de plein fouet  Les mastodontes américains Nvidia et AMD ont immédiatement accusé le coup en Bourse, avec des chutes respectives de 4,69% et 5,22%. Il faut dire que ces entreprises sont en première ligne sur le marché des puces pour l’IA et le cloud computing, des secteurs en plein boom mais qui pourraient pâtir d’un ralentissement plus global. Des inquiétudes renforcées par des rumeurs selon lesquelles le gouvernement américain pourrait restreindre les exportations de certaines puces vers le Moyen-Orient, de peur qu’elles ne finissent en Chine.  Un effet domino sur tout le secteur tech  De Broadcom (-3,47%) à Texas Instruments (-4,22%) en passant par Micron (-3,71%), c’est tout le secteur des semi-conducteurs qui a été entraîné dans la spirale baissière. Et par ricochet, l’ensemble du compartiment technologique, très dépendant des puces électroniques, a souffert. Il faut dire que depuis deux ans, les valeurs tech surfent sur la vague de la digitalisation accélérée par le Covid, dont l’IA et le cloud sont des moteurs essentiels. Un ralentissement de la croissance dans les semi-conducteurs pourrait remettre en cause ce scénario.  Des résultats solides passés au second plan  Paradoxalement, les bons résultats publiés par de nombreuses entreprises sont passés au second plan. Goldman Sachs, Bank of America ou encore Johnson & Johnson ont toutes dépassé les attentes, mais cela n’a pas suffi à enrayer la dynamique négative impulsée par les semi-conducteurs. Preuve que les craintes sur la croissance future pèsent plus lourd, aux yeux des investisseurs, que les performances passées.  Le marché a été distrait par la saga des semi-conducteurs, éclipsant de bons résultats par ailleurs.  – Quincy Krosby, stratégiste chez LPL Financial  Une consolidation salutaire ?

2024-11-26,Erudite Asia,"1,239 followers","Supermicro attacks mobile phone chips, TSMC sees multiple wafer orders expected in the second half of 2026  Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) plans to enter the mobile phone chip market, utilizing TSMC's 3nm process. This strategy will help sustain TSMC's 3nm capacity utilization at a high level, with orders projected through the second half of 2026. Supermicro, however, declined to comment on rumors about its potential mobile chip launches.  There are indications that Supermicro's MI300 series processors, currently aimed at AI servers, may expand into mobile devices using TSMC's 3nm process. AMD has previously collaborated with Samsung on the Exynos 2200 processor, which featured AMD's RDNA 2 architecture. Should Supermicro's APU be integrated into Samsung smartphones, it would highlight Samsung's ongoing use of TSMC-manufactured chips.  AMD is expected to remain one of TSMC's top three customers this year, continuing to build its partnership with the company. The MI300 series will leverage TSMC's 5nm process and advanced technologies through its 3DFabric platform. Demand for TSMC's 3nm technology continues to rise, with major clients like Apple, AMD, MediaTek, and Qualcomm securing orders into 2026, despite TSMC tripling its production capacity for 3nm.  TSMC's N3E technology variant is set to begin mass production by the end of 2023, targeting AI accelerators, high-end smartphones, and data centers. The N3P variant will follow in the second half of 2024, with broader applications anticipated by 2026. Meanwhile, N3X and N3A are designed for high-speed computing and automotive use, respectively. The mobile chip market remains highly competitive, with significant rivalry from vendors such as MediaTek and Qualcomm."

It simplifies GPU programming, making it the go-to for developers. Competitors like AMD and Intel have yet to offer anything as robust, giving NVIDIA a near-monopoly—much like Microsoft’s early dominance with Windows.  ➡️ 𝗔𝗜-𝗢𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗶𝘇𝗲𝗱 𝗛𝗮𝗿𝗱𝘄𝗮𝗿𝗲 Chips like NVIDIA’s 𝗛𝟭𝟬𝟬 and 𝗛𝟮𝟬𝟬 are purpose-built for AI, especially for models like ChatGPT. These GPUs excel in parallel computing and matrix operations, which are essential for training large AI models. Their performance is unmatched, setting them apart in the AI hardware space.  ➡️ 𝗔 𝗗𝗲𝗰𝗮𝗱𝗲-𝗟𝗼𝗻𝗴 𝗛𝗲𝗮𝗱 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁 NVIDIA’s early and substantial investments in AI hardware and software gave them a critical lead. While others were playing catch-up, NVIDIA was busy building the gold standard for AI infrastructure.  ➡️ 𝗜𝗻𝗳𝗿𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗱𝗲𝗿 Take Elon Musk’s 𝗖𝗼𝗹𝗼𝘀𝘀𝘂𝘀 𝗦𝘂𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝘂𝘁𝗲𝗿, powered by 𝟭𝟬𝟬,𝟬𝟬𝟬 𝗛𝟭𝟬𝟬 𝗚𝗣𝗨𝘀.

2024-11-26,Marius Pantea,Consulting Intermediary Agency Ltd,"🚨 Cracks Emerge in Nvidia's AI Armor: What Should Investors Do? 🚨  In recent weeks, Nvidia has been a shining star in the tech sector, primarily driven by explosive growth in AI demand and GPU sales. As businesses accelerate their digital transformation, Nvidia has positioned itself as the go-to provider for AI and data processing needs. However, recent reports indicate that not everything is as flawless as it seems.  Investor's Business Daily highlights emerging challenges for Nvidia as competition intensifies and market dynamics shift. While their leading technology and robust portfolio still make Nvidia a frontrunner, potential cracks are starting to show. Increased competition from companies such as AMD and Intel, along with potential regulatory scrutiny and market saturation, could pose significant risks to Nvidia's future growth.  For investors, this brings up an essential question: What should you do next?  1. **Stay Informed:** Continuous research is crucial. Look beyond stock performance and focus on industry trends, competitor movements, and potential market disruptions.  2. **Diversify Your Portfolio:** While Nvidia has been a strong performer, it’s wise to spread investments across multiple sectors. This strategy reduces risk and balances out potential losses in any single stock.  3. **Evaluate Long-Term Potential:** Short-term volatility is often a part of investing. Assess whether Nvidia’s fundamentals align with your long-term investment goals. If the company's growth story remains compelling, it may be worth holding or even buying on dips.  4. **Monitor Regulatory Developments:** As AI continues to gain traction, expect increased regulatory scrutiny. Investors should keep an eye on how these changes might impact Nvidia's business model and profitability.  5. **Engage in Discussion:** Share thoughts with fellow investors, analysts, and industry experts. Insights from different perspectives can help clarify the evolving landscape.  In conclusion, while Nvidia’s prospects are brighter than many, it’s crucial to recognize the cracks that are beginning to emerge. Staying informed, diversifying your investments, and keeping an eye on long-term potential will set you up for success amidst uncertainty.  What are your thoughts on Nvidia’s current position? Let’s discuss!  Source:"

I forgot a very key piece of my post: the amazing team of scientists I work with to build it!andare the two man army working on ingesting and linking over 250 million scientific and medical texts.  What's better: we are building these tools fully open source and compatible with a variety of open source and private LLMs.  One of the key features we were showing off at supercomputing was that we can run the entire application in a framework agnostic way. We can deploy it locally without a GPU, on Apple silicon, NVidia GPUs (on the NCATS HPC), and on AMD GPUs (on Frontier at ORNL).  We have the overly ambitious goal of making this as easily accessible as possible, so that it is possible to use safely and securely for proprietary and healthcare research. By enabling researchers to use locally deployed LLMs, proprietary and private health information can be used with the system without concern of sending data to 3rd party systems.  These two gentlemen are absolute wizards to take on such a large endeavor, both in the context of the sheer volume of texts we are ingesting as well as the additional challenge of designing it to run everywhere.  I feel very privileged to work with such talented people, and because of them I think we are bringing science fiction to reality."

The U.S. Department of Commerce has announced financial subsidies of up to $6.6 billion for TSMC's Arizona facility under the ""Chip Act,"" intended to create jobs and lessen U.S. dependence on Taiwanese chips. The Phoenix plant is projected to begin full production in early 2025.  While TSMC's Arizona facility will boost U.S. semiconductor production, it will not produce chips as advanced as those made in Taiwan. The Phoenix fab is set to manufacture 4-nanometer chips, while TSMC currently produces 3-nanometer chips in Taiwan. Further advancements, such as the upcoming 2-nanometer process, will not be matched by U.S. outputs for some time.  The Biden administration seeks to enhance domestic chip production while still relying on Taiwan. Major companies like NVIDIA, Apple, Qualcomm, and AMD are expected to continue sourcing chips from Taiwan. As TSMC focuses on research and development in Taiwan, it retains a competitive advantage in advanced technology, highlighting Taiwan’s critical role in the global semiconductor industry."

A Moore machine is a subclass of FSM in which output is dependent solely on the present state. This characteristic makes it deterministic, well-suited for uses where expected functionality is of great importance.  🎯 Even Parity Generator  The idea sounds simple but is significant: the number of 1s in the succeeded binary sequence must be preserved as even; this is achieved by adding the appropriate parity bit. Here’s the Moore machine approach towards the issue:  States: Indicates if the sequence has even number or odd number of 1s.  Transitions: Event Occurrences defined by one or zero input bits.  Output: The output value is decided by the existing state making it a parity output generator.  🌟 Applications  Generators of the parity type circuits like these are vital for the mechanisms of error detection and correction in data transfer and storage.

2024-11-29,Deepak gupta,Technical Author at TechShali,"Last Monday, the first images of this new generation were leaked through Amazon through the two models that ASRock plans to launch with 2 and 3 fans respectively and where all the specs.  Yesterday it appeared in Geekbench a performance test of the Intel Arc B580 with a performance that should be taken with a grain of salt and that, at first, does not seem like a good option for the most demanding users. Intel launched the Intel Arc range two years ago at a lower than normal price compared to NVIDIA and amd and, even so, it didn’t go well at all.  With the Intel Arc B580 Battlemage, the guys at Intel want to follow the same pricing strategy and according to the latest leak, it will be priced at only $250.  Price of the Intel Arc B580 Battlemage Intel’s second attempt to position itself in the graphics card market dominated with an iron fist by NVIDIA and with AMD with a minimal part of the pie, seems to follow the same pricing strategy. This new generation uses Xe2-HPG architecture to improve not only performance but also efficiency and includes, of course, improved support for ray tracing. The success of the Intel Arc B580, as with any graphics card or processor, not only depends on a good pricing strategy, but also on its performance and what the drivers are capable of offering.    Intel Arc B580 Limited Edition Graphics Box31P06HB0BA735858549271$250😐  November 27, 2024 • 13:54     Once again, the source of this information comes from the X (Twitter) user momomo_us who has published various price screenshots from various websites. But, the most curious thing of all is that, as we can see in these images, there is talk of a limited edition. With that, we don’t know if it is a promotional launch version or if it is simply a commercial claim that is going nowhere. What do we know about the Intel Arc B580 The Intel Arc B580 will reach the mid-range market, it has 12 GB GDDR6 video memory and 20 Xe2 cores. This means 4 GB less memory and 4 cores than the previous generation, figures that should be compensated with the new architecture since, otherwise, it makes no sense for Intel to go down the path of efficiency instead of performance at the same time. What have you done with the new ones? Core Ultra 200 Series. Another aspect that also draws attention to this new generation of Intel graphics is that, for now, it seems that ASRock is the only manufacturer that wants to give Intel a new opportunity, at least based on the information we know so far. Regarding the release date, if we continue this pace of leaks, it is likely that tomorrow or at most Monday we will know.",0.543,NEGATIVE,1.0

If you've ever been stuck choosing between a fast clock speed or more cores, you’re not alone—it’s a classic PC buyer’s dilemma! Clock speed measures how quickly your processor can execute tasks, while cores handle multiple tasks simultaneously. Gamers, developers, and casual users might prioritize these differently.

Некогда слово ""Intel"" вызывало у нас, зубров, стоявших у истоков компьютеризации на постсоветском пространстве, душевный трепет. А сегодня у Intel 16,6 млрд долларов убытка, капитализация в 32 раза ниже, чем у Nvidia, и исключение из индекса Dow Jones Industrial...  Вчера прочитала интересную статью в ""Новой"" на тему того, как неповоротливость компании привела туда, куда привела.  Автор отмечает три ключевые вехи:  1. Отказ от сотрудничества с Apple (2007): Intel отверг предложение Apple создать процессор для первого iPhone, посчитав проект недостаточно прибыльным. В итоге Apple выбрала ARM-архитектуру, которая стала стандартом для мобильных устройств, а Intel навсегда потерял этот рынок.  2. Отставание в производственных техпроцессах: Intel задержалась с внедрением 10-нм и 7-нм технологий, что позволило конкурентам, таким как TSMC и AMD, выйти вперед с более эффективными и производительными чипами.  3. Игнорирование рынка ИИ: Intel не сумела вовремя инвестировать в разработку специализированных решений для искусственного интеллекта (GPU, TPU). Это позволило Nvidia занять лидирующую позицию и доминировать в сегменте вычислений для ИИ.  Желаю всем нам гибкости ума, счастливой пятницы и удачного закрытия ноября!)",0.509,POSITIVE,0.992

The Challenging Landscape of 2014  When Su took the helm as CEO in 2014, AMD was at its lowest point. The company had been struggling for years, relegated to being a cheap alternative to Intel, with a processor architecture plagued by high power consumption and poor performance. Critical talent was leaving, including key architects like Jim Keller and Raja Koduri, casting further doubt on the company's future.  The Zen Revolution  Su's strategic masterstroke was the development of the Zen architecture, a complete redesign focusing on performance, efficiency, and scalability. Launched in 2017, Zen became the foundation for AMD's remarkable comeback. Successive iterations - Zen+, Zen 2, Zen 3, and Zen 4 - consistently improved processor performance, reduced power consumption, and increased core counts.  Market Transformation  The results have been nothing short of extraordinary:  - Desktop CPU market share rose from approximately 20% in 2014 to around 29% in 2024 - Server market share climbed from virtually zero to an impressive 24% - AMD's Ryzen and EPYC product lines have challenged Intel's long-standing dominance - $222B AMD market value in 2024  Breaking into New Territories  Beyond desktop and server markets, AMD has made significant strides in mobile computing and specialized markets. The Ryzen Mobile series and EPYC server processors have demonstrated the company's technological prowess and ability to innovate.

I joined via the Bluefish acquisition and immediately was amongst a team of rockstars ⭐️that created innovative usage based insurance solutions, smartsource PMO agreements and landed one of the first 💥smartfactory4.0 in Spain. We then moved into the heart ❤️ of Vodafone Global Enterprise and I was privileged to be asked to run the Global Innovation Programme! 😊Working with innovation teams across the world we were fortunate to ideate with top global Enterprise Customers and partners! Redesigning🧑‍💻 digital transformation journeys, handling sophisticated cloud migration programmes and accelerating 📈innovation through fintech and M-pesa expansions. We landed the first mobile private Network 🏆implementation amd it was at that point I discovered Innovation could execute the corporate strategy! My journey 🚗then took me into the world of Vodafone Group Technology where we drove incubators to establish new platform business models. 💸This gave rise to STEP ( safer transport Europe Platform) 🚌enhancing road safety , digital asset broker ( pairpoint- sim trust blockchain for IOT) and Drones 🚁API strategy. We learnt to move at pace and scale utilising the three lenses of desirability, feasibility and viability! The Innovation Factory 🚀in partnership with Tomorrow Street & Accenture was born! We also had a lot of fun spending time in our customers shoes! Covid 🎯hit the world hard but our Innovation factory moved to digital and helped our critical infrastructure customers to innovate 💡to operate. Focusing on ux design, prototyping, testing and cocreating on site with our customers during Covid is one of my most ❤️proudest career highlights! In 2023 my travels took me to VBUK and we joined the growth products together with Innovation. This drove real momentum for 5G slicing at Glastonbury, 🎸press and media events 🎤at Downing Street and landed significant tech commercialisation in public sector initiatives, network as a Sensor capturing environmental data 🌎, IT service management and understanding operational blueprints for AI and emerging tech. I have LOVED the people, the experiences and the innovation journey with customers around the world! I finally managed to get an IP registered this year and I truly hope it will help MNOS to monetise the way in which 5G will change the world of work. As I reflect 👀on the past 10 years I realise work is an activity not a place you go!

RNIB Eyeware is an innovative new app which immerses users in experiences of sight loss by applying filters for eight eye conditions, which can be adjusted for severity.  It enables friends and family, and health and other professionals to better understand what blind and partially sighted people experience. It’s also a way to highlight the importance of accessibility - products, services, street design, and workplace adjustments.  RNIB Eyeware is available for both iOS and Android, and can also be accessed via your mobile browser.

2024-11-30,Academy of Management Discoveries,175 followers,"💡 Who really controls workplace technology?  We often see workplace technology as neutral—a tool shaped by how employees use it. But in reality, developers are at the center of a complex balancing act, navigating competing demands from high-powered managers, low-powered workers, and external stakeholders like policymakers, activists, and progressive employers. The challenge becomes even more complex because many developers work across multiple client organizations. This raises the question: How do developers influence workplace technologies and navigate these power dynamics?  A recentDiscoveries study by Jenna E. Myers uncovers two pathways through which developers of a digital manufacturing monitoring tool managed these tensions:  🚀 Developers addressed cross-occupational differences by reconciling the conflicting needs of managers and workers, encoding workers' preferences into design prototypes. 🚀 When managers resisted features designed for workers, developers strategically limited managerial pushback and released inclusive updates.  Key takeaways- 🌟 Developers aren’t just technologists—they’re power brokers. 🌟Balancing stakeholder demands requires strategies that prioritize inclusivity without alienating decision-makers. 🌟Future research should explore how developers can challenge traditional managerial control while fostering equity across organizations.  The challenge ahead is: How do we empower technology architects to design tools that prioritize fairness and inclusivity in the workplace?

2024-11-30,Steven Wood,"Managing Director, Chief Operating Officer, Operations Director of over 30 years experience in the Food Manufacturing Industry","In  hashtag #leadership the ability to give …. And take ….effective feedback is one of the true differentiators between the best and the rest  On one side (giving) is a skill that requires a powerful combination of objectivity, empathy and precision. Whilst on the over (taking) requires us to be open, put the ego away, and be growth orientated. It also requires consideration of the environment and the mood of the other person in the equation  Typically we see a situation where all too often focus excessively on one form of feedback, without a balanced approach. We also see a world where leaders are reluctant to take feedback on themselves, as such having little visibility on how they are viewed by those around them  These two faults are hugely disengaging. To be excessively criticised or overly praised is of no benefit to anybody. Equally to have a leader who is not interested in receiving feedback means we simply look at them as robots with no care for the views of those around them  And yet - when we can get it right - it makes a huge difference. When a leader can balance their coaching and mentoring responsibilities and provide colleagues with intelligent, well meaning and constructive feedback we become hugely engaged and committed - we see a leader interested in our development as people and willing to put the time and effort into us  Equality when a leader is prepared to take feedback we see a fellow human being, trying to listen and get better as a person before they focus on those around them - we like to see vulnerability and accepting feedback is a genuine way makes us look and feel like human beings  It is therefore a balanced 4 way approach we are seeking to achieve in feedback which is captured in the attached infographic. The model we should aim for  - Advisory feedback - where we are given the benefit of experience amd knowledge relating to our challenges - Suggestive feedback - where we are offered options and choices to address our issues - Complimentary feedback where we are praised specifically for our role in outcomes - where we did well. - Critucal feedback where we assess situations and look for how we could have done better  All four forms of feedback have an important role to play. Both in the development of those around you - but also in the development of yourself. All should be absorbed and embraced for different reasons  When we can get the balance right and the quality of the feedback is based on specifics and examples, then it becomes a hugely powerful force for growth and development  Feedback is not something to be intimidated by, nor should it be used as a blunt instrument of control. It is to be embraced and invested in from a time and capability perepctive. It is ultimately the greatest way we can convey honesty and devotion at a one to one human level  When we accept that principle and then act upon it both in terms of what we do and supporting others we have the basis for growth and self development",0.523,NEGATIVE,0.645

The author thinks that Intel shoudl focus on IFS and not on X86 architecture. While only China could build up a Foundry competing with TSMC, the time has passed for the US and UE.  Intel's Board of Directors: A Catalyst for Decline  This paper provides a comprehensive examination of Intel's leadership issues, strategic missteps, and eroding market position.  • Board incompetence: 7 of 11 members lack relevant semiconductor experience • Cultural shift: From engineering focus to business-oriented management • Process technology failures: 10nm node debacle allowed competitors to gain market share • Erosion of x86 dominance: Rise of Arm-based processors in client and server markets  The authors trace Intel's problems to the appointment of Paul Otellini as CEO, marking a shift from technical leadership to business-oriented management. This change led to a cultural transformation that prioritized political power over technical excellence.  Intel's failure in developing its 10nm process node is identified as a critical turning point, enabling competitors like TSMC and AMD to gain significant market share. The paper also discusses the erosion of Intel's x86 moat in both client and server markets, with Arm-based processors and accelerated computing solutions posing significant threats.  The analysis extends to Intel's financial decisions, criticizing the focus on stock buybacks over capital expenditures during Bob Swan's tenure as CEO. This approach is described as malpractice in a capital-intensive industry when the company was losing market share and lagging in process technology.  The paper argues that Intel's board has made a series of poor decisions, culminating in the dismissal of Pat Gelsinger and a renewed focus on x86 products. The authors contend that this strategy is misguided and unlikely to address Intel's fundamental challenges.  Limitations of the study include potential bias in assessing board decisions and a focus on internal factors without fully exploring external market dynamics. The analysis may also underestimate the challenges faced by Arm-based processors in fully displacing x86 in certain markets.  This comprehensive analysis provides valuable insights into the challenges faced by established technology companies in maintaining market leadership and the critical role of board decisions in shaping a company's trajectory.",0.548,NEGATIVE,0.998

2024-12-13,Deepak gupta,Technical Author at TechShali,"MachineGames has already released the first patch for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle (you can see our analysis here), and since the game has been made available to users starting today we can say that it is the typical “day one patch.” However, it has already become controversial due to the fact that it enables Path Tracing for users who have a graph of NVIDIAbut it leaves the holders of a graph of amd. Let’s explain it.   In fact, although we have already analyzed the new Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, it was because they gave us access to the game beforehand and that means that, what we were able to test it, we were not able to see such outstanding features as Path Tracing, which we It’s available right now. Well, that’s if we used an NVIDIA graphics card, of course… Indiana Jones leaves AMD users without FSR As the developer explains in the patch notes“Added full ray tracing (Path Tracing) functionality for supported NVIDIA graphics cards. To use this function, a graphics card with a minimum of 12 GB of VRAM is required. “We are also working to add support for AMD FSR in a future update.” Future update, you know, so for now nothing at all. As you can see in the video embedded above, the visual difference when using Path Tracing is quite interesting, especially in a game like this that supports ray tracing in shadows, reflections and even indirect lighting, settings that can be modified at will in the graphical options within the game. Of course, as you will surely realize if you watch this video, an RTX 4080 suffers quite a bit with all these settings activated, and the FPS drops to practically half.  This is one of the reasons why AMD users will be eagerly waiting for FSR technology to be implemented in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, since it is a way that, as we have seen on many other occasions, you can play with a high level of frames per second without giving up graphic quality, something that significantly improves the gaming experience… and the truth is, having a fairly top graphics and then having to play at just over 30 FPS is quite unfortunate. This day 1 patch also fixes a good handful of issues and bugs from the preview version, which is the one we played, but it also adds some pretty interesting additional options, such as the “reset values” option in the Options menu. In any case, practically everything in this patch is to solve problems detected in the initial version, which is why it is more than recommended that, whether you have an NVIDIA or AMD graphics card, you install it. And if your graphics card is AMD, then you will have to wait a little longer (probably a matter of one or two weeks) to be able to enjoy it properly.",0.53,NEGATIVE,1.0
2024-12-13,Joanne Woo,"Global VP, Division Head of Marketing & Communications at ABB | Curator, TEDxMelbourne","Lisa Su, CEO of AMD, has been named TIME's 2024 CEO of the Year, and it’s a well-earned recognition. Her story really resonates with me, and I wanted to share why I find her so inspiring.  Breaking barriers Born in Taiwan and raised in New York City, Lisa discovered her love for STEM early on, even building a hurricane simulator for a school project. She went on to earn a Ph.D. in electrical engineering at MIT, working her way through a male-dominated field to lead one of the most important companies in the world. Today, AMD is at the heart of the technology we use every day, from AI to supercomputing.  Turning AMD around When Lisa became CEO in 2014, AMD was struggling. Its stock was at $3, and people thought the company wouldn’t survive much longer. Under her leadership, AMD has not only survived but thrived, with its stock rising nearly 50-fold. She focused on rebuilding the company’s products, repairing customer relationships, and simplifying the business. It’s an incredible turnaround story.  Here's what I've learnt from reading about Lisa's leadership philosophy:  • Set big goals: She inspired her team by aiming high, like designing a CPU chip that was 40% faster than its predecessor.  • Focus and simplification matter: She rejected short-term distractions to double down on AMD's strengths, creating clarity and alignment across the organization.  • Be resilient: She balanced long-term goals with short-term wins to keep the company afloat while giving her team time to innovate.  • Invest in people: She’s known for building strong teams and holding everyone accountable, including herself.  Also, isn't it great to see an Asian American be recognized as CEO of the year? We need to see more diversity in leadership reporting, like this. As my Gen Alpha daughter would say: ""she slays!"".  I’m inspired by Lisa’s story of overcoming challenges to lead on a global stage. She’s shown that great leadership is about resilience, focus, and empowering others to do their best work.  Lisa’s story reminds me that leadership isn’t about being perfect - it’s about staying the course, making tough decisions, and inspiring people along the way. Congratulations to Lisa on this well-deserved honor.  What do you find most inspiring about Lisa’s story? I’d love to hear your thoughts.  Read the article here:",0.553,POSITIVE,0.999

From an early age, learning is centered on identifying challenges and discovering ways to overcome them, whether it’s mastering basic skills like counting, reading, or forming social connections.  As individuals grow, they confront more advanced challenges, from scientific research and mathematical concepts to addressing broader societal issues.

2024-12-14,Danielle Z,AI Computer Data Analysis Innovation Driver|Technology Leader|AI Solutions Director,"Liquid AI just raised $250M to develop a more efficient type of AI model Liquid AI, an AI startup co-founded by robotics luminary Daniela Rus, has raised $250 million in a Series A led by AMD. Per Bloomberg, the round values Liquid AI at over $2 billion. Liquid AI aims to build general-purpose AI systems powered by a relatively new type of AI model called a liquid neural network. Liquid neural networks consist of “neurons” governed by equations that predict each individual neuron’s behavior over time. The “liquid” bit in the term “liquid neural networks” refers to the architecture’s flexibility; inspired by the “brains” of roundworms, not only are liquid neural networks much smaller than traditional AI models, but they require far less computing power to run.  Liquid AI aims to develop tailored liquid neural networks for applications like e-commerce, consumer electronics, and biotech. As part of AMD’s investment, Liquid AI says it’ll work with the chipmaker to optimize its models for AMD’s GPUs, CPUs, and AI accelerators.",0.553,POSITIVE,0.794
