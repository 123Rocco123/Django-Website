With a visionary woman CEO ‚Äì Dr, and AMD‚Äôs focus on supporting women in engineering, an apt way for us to contribute was to create a special program for young women engineers who are just about to embark on their education in engineering. My team put together a well-thought-out program to form a cohort of 100 women engineers who would be identified from the first year of engineering from colleges in the regions we operate, and we would then nurture their engineering career over the period of four years of their course. But, the lofty goal was not just to create a great engineering career for these young women but also to create women leaders in the semiconductor industry in the future.  100 women engineers from PES College of Engineering are now travelling this journey with me and my team in this cohort. I recently met them in the sprawlingcampus in Bangalore, and it was a memorable day for the young students as they explored the world of semiconductors through engineering demos, connecting with senior women engineers, meeting their alumni and overall experiencing their first step into any corporate set up. I had the wonderful opportunity to deliver a keynote to these 100 women engineers on building a successful engineering career and taking the right steps towards building themselves as strong women and women leaders.campus was filled with a burst of energy, smiles, selfies and positivity as these young students went around the campus and spoke with our employees.

10/6/2024,AMD,"1,608,939 followers","You asked, we answered: Is it better to deploy AI services locally or via the cloud?  The question of whether local AI or cloud-based AI is better depends on the end-users‚Äô needs and the characteristics of the application.  Local AI computing provides the advantage of improved latency. It takes less time for the CPU, GPU, or NPU built into a system to spin up and start processing a task than it does to send that same task to a server located hundreds or thousands of miles away. Keeping data local may also help to improve user privacy since these devices are designed to keep sensitive information from being inadvertently transmitted or shared.  The advantage of running a workload in the cloud is scale, which at times outweighs the need for quick response times or the intrinsic desire to keep certain data private. Sending data to a distant server may take a measurable amount of time, but remote data center services (aka cloud-based services), can run a given query on an array of hardware that is far more powerful than any single laptop, desktop, or workstation.  Both cloud and local AI services are complimentary to each other, creating an opportunity for future hybrid services that will combine the best of both options.",0.5432,POSITIVE,0.9327
